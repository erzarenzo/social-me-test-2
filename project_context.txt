1. Overview of SocialMe

SocialMe is an AI-driven content creation system designed to generate high-quality articles using web-crawled sources, AI-based structuring, and advanced LLM integration (Anthropic's Claude API). The platform automates source collection, article structuring, AI-enhanced content generation, and evaluation, making it a scalable tool for producing engaging, research-backed content.
