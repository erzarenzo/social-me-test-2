        "Your cognitive style reveals a mind that primarily utilizes Analytical thinking, particularly using Analogical reasoning as a framework. This is evident in your focus on concepts like 'What began as simple rule-based expert systems has evolved into sophisticated neural networks capable of recognizing patterns, understanding natural language, and even generating creative content' and 'The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence: From Rule-Based Systems to Deep Learning\n    \n    Artificial intelligence has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past few decades'. This creates a distinctive approach in the Educational domain.",
        "Your communication reveals a pattern of integrating Analytical and Systematic processing, where you combine seemingly different cognitive approaches to create a unique synthesis. This is reflected in your 99% analytical to 1% creative balance.",
