Just last week, I found myself in an almost cinematic scenario. While discussing potential security upgrades with a fintech leader, the conversation took a dramatic turn reminiscent of a thriller novel. 'We can secure your current transactions,' he said, 'but scaling up will require cryptographic resources that aren't yet available.' In the rapidly moving world of blockchain, waiting for these advancements feels like asking the Wright brothers to invent a jet engine. The reality is stark: we face a security bottleneck that few in the broader tech community seem to grasp. As companies rush to harness blockchain's potential, the infrastructure that ensures its integrity is struggling to keep pace. This is more than just a technical hiccup; it is a critical juncture that could redefine the future of digital finance. The gap in security solutions is not merely a technological shortfall; it's a looming threat to the credibility of the entire blockchain ecosystem.",

          "sample_text": "In the realm of renewable energy, an unsettling truth has come to light: our capacity to store energy lags dangerously behind our ability to generate it. Recently, while visiting a solar farm in Southern Spain, I encountered a situation that seemed pulled from the pages of a speculative fiction story. 'We can produce enough solar power for a small city,' the engineer explained, 'but storing enough for night-time use remains a challenge we won\u2019t solve before 2025.' In the renewable energy sector, this delay is tantamount to telling Thomas Edison he could light a single bulb today but would need to wait years for a power grid. The pressing issue is one of storage innovation\u2014a challenge that many outside the sector underestimate. As nations strive to meet ambitious climate goals, the systems that store renewable energy are under unprecedented strain. This is not just a technical dilemma; it is a pivotal moment that will shape the trajectory of global energy policy. The storage conundrum is not merely an engineering oversight; it's a strategic vulnerability that threatens the viability of sustainable energy initiatives.",

Just a fortnight ago, I found myself in an almost surreal discussion with an educational technology consortium. 'We can provide access to high-speed internet for urban centers,' they informed me, 'but rural connectivity won\u2019t be feasible until 2026.' In the fast-paced world of digital learning, this timeline is akin to telling Johannes Gutenberg he could print a single book today but would need to wait decades to mass-produce them. The stark reality is that we face a digital divide crisis that many policymakers overlook. As educational institutions pivot to online platforms, the digital backbone supporting these initiatives is stretched to its limits. This is not merely a technical setback; it is a critical inflection point that will determine the future of educational equity. The access gap is not just a technological hurdle; it is a profound challenge to the very notion of equal opportunity in education.",

In some cases, it can exceed or augment human capabilities by providing better or faster ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] As the widespread use of AI in healthcare is still relatively new, research is ongoing into its applications across various medical subdisciplines and related industries. AI programs are being applied to practices such as diagnostics , [ 4 ] treatment protocol development, [ 5 ] drug development , [ 6 ] personalized medicine , [ 7 ] and patient monitoring and care. [ 8 ] Since radiographs are the most commonly performed imaging tests in radiology, the potential for AI to assist with triage and interpretation of radiographs is particularly significant. [ 9 ] Using AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy , automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases . [ 10 ] Furthermore, new technologies such as AI are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption. [ 11 ] In contrast, there are also several cases where AI has been put to use in healthcare without proper testing. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic. [ 16 ] Moreover, meta-studies have found that the scientific literature on AI in healthcare often suffers from a lack of reproducibility . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Applications in healthcare systems [ edit ] Disease diagnosis [ edit ] Accurate and early diagnosis of diseases is still a challenge in healthcare. Recognizing medical conditions and their symptoms is a complex problem. AI can assist clinicians with its data processing capabilities to save time and improve accuracy. [ 21 ] Through the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence can be able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the analysis of mass electronic health records (EHRs). [ 22 ] AI can help early prediction, for example, of Alzheimer's disease and dementias , by looking through large numbers of similar cases and possible treatments. [ 23 ] AI can aid doctors' decision-making in emergency cases, for example, in emergency departments. AI algorithms may assist in prioritizing critical cases, cutting down waiting times. Also, AI-backed decision support systems make recommendations instantly and enable quicker interpretation of data, which supports healthcare professionals' decisions. [ 21 ] In 2023 a study reported higher satisfaction rates with ChatGPT -generated responses compared with those from physicians for medical questions posted on Reddit \u2019s r/AskDocs. [ 24 ] Evaluators preferred ChatGPT's responses to physician responses in 78.6% of 585 evaluations, noting better quality and empathy. The authors noted that these were isolated questions taken from an online forum, not in the context of an established patient-physician relationship. [ 24 ] Moreover, responses were not graded on the accuracy of medical information, and some have argued that the experiment was not properly blinded , with the evaluators being coauthors of the study. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Recent developments in statistical physics , machine learning , and inference algorithms are also being explored for their potential in improving medical diagnostic approaches. [ 28 ] Also, the establishment of large healthcare-related data warehouses of sometimes hundreds of millions of patients provides extensive training data for AI models. [ 29 ] Electronic health records [ edit ] Electronic health records (EHR) are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. Now that around 80% of medical practices use EHR, some anticipate the use of artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians. [ 30 ] One application uses natural language processing (NLP) to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms. [ 30 ] For example, the term heart attack and myocardial infarction mean the same things, but physicians may use one over the other based on personal preferences. [ 30 ] NLP algorithms consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed. [ 30 ] Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician's notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read. [ 30 ] Other applications use concept processing to analyze the information entered by the current patient's doctor to present similar cases and help the physician remember to include all relevant details. [ 31 ] Beyond making content edits to an EHR, there are AI algorithms that evaluate an individual patient's record and predict a risk for a disease based on their previous information and family history. [ 32 ] One general algorithm is a rule-based system that makes decisions similarly to how humans use flow charts. [ 33 ] This system takes in large amounts of data and creates a set of rules that connect specific observations to concluded diagnoses. [ 33 ] Thus, the algorithm can take in a new patient's data and try to predict the likeliness that they will have a certain condition or disease. [ 33 ] Since the algorithms can evaluate a patient's information based on collective data, they can find any outstanding issues to bring to a physician's attention and save time. [ 32 ] One study conducted by the Centerstone research institute found that predictive modeling of EHR data has achieved 70\u201372% accuracy in predicting individualized treatment response. [ 34 ] These methods are helpful due to the fact that the amount of online health records doubles every five years. [ 32 ] Physicians do not have the bandwidth to process all this data manually, and AI can leverage this data to assist physicians in treating their patients. [ 32 ] Drug interactions [ edit ] Improvements in natural language processing led to the development of algorithms to identify drug-drug interactions in medical literature. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Drug-drug interactions pose a threat to those taking multiple medications simultaneously, and the danger increases with the number of medications being taken. [ 39 ] To address the difficulty of tracking all known or suspected drug-drug interactions, machine learning algorithms have been created to extract information on interacting drugs and their possible effects from medical literature. Efforts were consolidated in 2013 in the DDIExtraction Challenge, in which a team of researchers at Carlos III University assembled a corpus of literature on drug-drug interactions to form a standardized test for such algorithms. [ 40 ] Competitors were tested on their ability to accurately determine, from the text, which drugs were shown to interact and what the characteristics of their interactions were. [ 41 ] Researchers continue to use this corpus to standardize the measurement of the effectiveness of their algorithms. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 38 ] Other algorithms identify drug-drug interactions from patterns in user-generated content , especially electronic health records and/or adverse event reports. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Organizations such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the World Health Organization's VigiBase allow doctors to submit reports of possible negative reactions to medications. Deep learning algorithms have been developed to parse these reports and detect patterns that imply drug-drug interactions. [ 42 ] Telemedicine [ edit ] An elderly man using a pulse oximeter to measure his blood oxygen levels The increase of telemedicine , the treatment of patients remotely, has shown the rise of possible AI applications. [ 43 ] AI can assist in caring for patients remotely by monitoring their information through sensors. [ 44 ] A wearable device may allow for constant monitoring of a patient and the ability to notice changes that may be less distinguishable by humans. The information can be compared to other data that has already been collected using artificial intelligence algorithms that alert physicians if there are any issues to be aware of. [ 44 ] Another application of artificial intelligence is chat-bot therapy. Some researchers charge that the reliance on chatbots for mental healthcare does not offer the reciprocity and accountability of care that should exist in the relationship between the consumer of mental healthcare and the care provider (be it a chat-bot or psychologist), though. [ 45 ] Some examples of these chatbots include Woebot, Earkick and Wysa. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Since the average age has risen due to a longer life expectancy, artificial intelligence could be useful in helping take care of older populations. [ 49 ] Tools such as environment and personal sensors can identify a person's regular activities and alert a caretaker if a behavior or a measured vital is abnormal. [ 49 ] Although the technology is useful, there are also discussions about limitations of monitoring in order to respect a person's privacy since there are technologies that are designed to map out home layouts and detect human interactions. [ 49 ] Workload management [ edit ] AI has the potential to streamline care coordination and reduce the workload. AI algorithms can automate administrative tasks, prioritize patient needs and facilitate seamless communication in a healthcare team. [ 50 ] This enables healthcare providers to focus more on direct patient care and ensures the efficient and coordinated delivery of healthcare services. Clinical applications [ edit ] Cardiovascular [ edit ] Artificial intelligence algorithms have shown promising results in accurately diagnosing and risk stratifying patients with concern for coronary artery disease, showing potential as an initial triage tool. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Other algorithms have been used in predicting patient mortality, medication effects, and adverse events following treatment for acute coronary syndrome . [ 51 ] Wearables, smartphones, and internet-based technologies have also shown the ability to monitor patients' cardiac data points, expanding the amount of data and the various settings AI models can use and potentially enabling earlier detection of cardiac events occurring outside of the hospital. [ 53 ] A research in 2019 found that AI can be used to predict heart attack with up to 90% accuracy. [ 54 ] Another growing area of research is the utility of AI in classifying heart sounds and diagnosing valvular disease . [ 55 ] Challenges of AI in cardiovascular medicine have included the limited data available to train machine learning models, such as limited data on social determinants of health as they pertain to cardiovascular disease . [ 56 ] A key limitation in early studies evaluating AI were omissions of data comparing algorithmic performance to humans. Examples of studies which assess AI performance relative to physicians includes how AI is non-inferior to humans in interpretation of cardiac echocardiograms [ 57 ] and that AI can diagnose heart attack better than human physicians in the emergency setting, reducing both low-value testing and missed diagnoses. [ 58 ] In cardiovascular tissue engineering and organoid studies, AI is increasingly used to analyze microscopy images, and integrate electrophysiological read outs. [ 59 ] Dermatology [ edit ] Medical imaging (such as X-ray and photography) is a commonly used tool in dermatology [ 60 ] and the development of deep learning has been strongly tied to image processing . Therefore, there is a natural fit between the dermatology and deep learning. Machine learning learning holds great potential to process these images for better diagnoses. [ 61 ] Han et al. showed keratinocytic skin cancer detection from face photographs. [ 62 ] Esteva et al. demonstrated dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer from lesion images. [ 63 ] Noyan et al. demonstrated a convolutional neural network that achieved 94% accuracy at identifying skin cells from microscopic Tzanck smear images. [ 64 ] A concern raised with this work is that it has not engaged with disparities related to skin color or differential treatment of patients with non-white skin tones. [ 65 ] According to some researchers, AI algorithms have been shown to be more effective than dermatologists at identifying cancer. [ 66 ] However, a 2021 review article found that a majority of papers analyzing the performance of AI algorithms designed for skin cancer classification failed to use external test sets. [ 67 ] Only four research studies were found in which the AI algorithms were tested on clinics, regions, or populations distinct from those it was trained on, and in each of those four studies, the performance of dermatologists was found to be on par with that of the algorithm. Moreover, only one study [ 68 ] was set in the context of a full clinical examination; others were based on interaction through web-apps or online questionnaires, with most based entirely on context-free images of lesions. In this study, it was found that dermatologists significantly outperformed the algorithms. Many articles claiming superior performance of AI algorithms also fail to distinguish between trainees and board-certified dermatologists in their analyses. [ 67 ] It has also been suggested that AI could be used to automatically evaluate the outcome of maxillo-facial surgery or cleft palate therapy in regard to facial attractiveness or age appearance. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Gastroenterology [ edit ] AI can play a role in various facets of the field of gastroenterology . Endoscopic exams such as esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD) and colonoscopies rely on rapid detection of abnormal tissue. By enhancing these endoscopic procedures with AI, clinicians can more rapidly identify diseases, determine their severity, and visualize blind spots. Early trials in using AI detection systems of early stomach cancer have shown sensitivity close to expert endoscopists. [ 71 ] AI can assist doctors treating ulcerative colitis in detecting the microscopic activity of the disease in people and predicting when flare-ups will happen. For example, an AI-powered tool was developed to analyse digitised bowel samples ( biopsies ). The tool was able to distinguish with 80% accuracy between samples that show remission of colitis and those with active disease. It also predicted the risk of a flare-up happening with the same accuracy. These rates of successfully using microscopic disease activity to predict disease flare are similar to the accuracy of pathologists . [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Obstetrics and gynaecology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence utilises massive amounts of data to help with predicting illness, prevention, and diagnosis, as well as patient monitoring. In obstetrics, artificial intelligence is utilized in magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and foetal cardiotocography. AI contributes in the resolution of a variety of obstetrical diagnostic issues. [ 74 ] Infectious diseases [ edit ] AI has shown potential in both the laboratory and clinical spheres of infectious disease medicine. [ 75 ] During the COVID-19 pandemic , AI has been used for early detection, tracking virus spread and analysing virus behaviour, among other things. [ 76 ] However, there were only a few examples of AI being used directly in clinical practice during the pandemic itself. [ 77 ] Other applications of AI around infectious diseases include support-vector machines identifying antimicrobial resistance , machine learning analysis of blood smears to detect malaria , and improved point-of-care testing of Lyme disease based on antigen detection. Additionally, AI has been investigated for improving diagnosis of meningitis , sepsis , and tuberculosis , as well as predicting treatment complications in hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients. [ 75 ] Musculoskeletal [ edit ] AI has been used to identify causes of knee pain that doctors miss, that disproportionately affect Black patients. [ 78 ] Underserved populations experience higher levels of pain. These disparities persist even after controlling for the objective severity of diseases like osteoarthritis, as graded by human physicians using medical images, raising the possibility that underserved patients\u2019 pain stems from factors external to the knee, such as stress. Researchers have conducted a study using a machine-learning algorithm to show that standard radiographic measures of severity overlook objective but undiagnosed features that disproportionately affect diagnosis and management of underserved populations with knee pain. They proposed that new algorithmic measure ALG-P could potentially enable expanded access to treatments for underserved patients. [ 79 ] Neurology [ edit ] The use of AI technologies has been explored for use in the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For diagnostic purposes, machine learning models have been developed that rely on structural MRI inputs. [ 80 ] The input datasets for these models are drawn from databases such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. [ 81 ] Researchers have developed models that rely on convolutional neural networks with the aim of improving early diagnostic accuracy. [ 82 ] Generative adversarial networks are a form of deep learning that have also performed well in diagnosing AD. [ 83 ] There have also been efforts to develop machine learning models into forecasting tools that can predict the prognosis of patients with AD. Forecasting patient outcomes through generative models has been proposed by researchers as a means of synthesizing training and validation sets. [ 84 ] They suggest that generated patient forecasts could be used to provide future models larger training datasets than current open access databases. Oncology [ edit ] AI has been explored for use in cancer diagnosis, risk stratification, molecular characterization of tumors, and cancer drug discovery. A particular challenge in oncologic care that AI is being developed to address is the ability to accurately predict which treatment protocols will be best suited for each patient based on their individual genetic, molecular, and tumor-based characteristics. [ 85 ] AI has been trialed in cancer diagnostics with the reading of imaging studies and pathology slides. [ 86 ] In January 2020, Google DeepMind announced an algorithm capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer detection in screening scans. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] A number of researchers, including Trevor Hastie , Joelle Pineau , and Robert Tibshirani among others, published a reply claiming that DeepMind's research publication in Nature lacked key details on methodology and code, \"effectively undermin[ing] its scientific value\" and making it impossible for the scientific community to confirm the work. [ 89 ] In the MIT Technology Review , author Benjamin Haibe-Kains characterized DeepMind's work as \"an advertisement\" having little to do with science. [ 90 ] In July 2020, it was reported that an AI algorithm developed by the University of Pittsburgh achieves the highest accuracy to date in identifying prostate cancer , with 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] In 2023 a study reported the use of AI for CT -based radiomics classification at grading the aggressiveness of retroperitoneal sarcoma with 82% accuracy compared with 44% for lab analysis of biopsies. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Ophthalmology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence-enhanced technology is being used as an aid in the screening of eye disease and prevention of blindness. [ 95 ] In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the marketing of the first medical device to diagnose a specific type of eye disease, diabetic retinopathy using an artificial intelligence algorithm. [ 96 ] Moreover, AI technology may be used to further improve \"diagnosis rates\" because of the potential to decrease detection time. [ 97 ] Pathology [ edit ] Further information: Digital pathology Ki67 stain calculation by the open-source software QuPath in a pure seminoma, which gives a measure of the proliferation rate of the tumor. The colors represent the intensity of expression: blue-no expression, yellow-low, orange-moderate, and red-high expression. [ 98 ] For many diseases, pathological analysis of cells and tissues is considered to be the gold standard of disease diagnosis. Methods of digital pathology allows microscopy slides to be scanned and digitally analyzed. AI-assisted pathology tools have been developed to assist with the diagnosis of a number of diseases, including breast cancer, hepatitis B, gastric cancer , and colorectal cancer . AI has also been used to predict genetic mutations and prognosticate disease outcomes. [ 71 ] AI is well-suited for use in low-complexity pathological analysis of large-scale screening samples, such as colorectal or breast cancer screening, thus lessening the burden on pathologists and allowing for faster turnaround of sample analysis. [ 99 ] Several deep learning and artificial neural network models have shown accuracy similar to that of human pathologists, [ 99 ] and a study of deep learning assistance in diagnosing metastatic breast cancer in lymph nodes showed that the accuracy of humans with the assistance of a deep learning program was higher than either the humans alone or the AI program alone. [ 100 ] Additionally, implementation of digital pathology is predicted to save over $12 million for a university center over the course of five years, [ 101 ] though savings attributed to AI specifically have not yet been widely researched. The use of augmented and virtual reality could prove to be a stepping stone to wider implementation of AI-assisted pathology, as they can highlight areas of concern on a pathology sample and present them in real-time to a pathologist for more efficient review. [ 99 ] AI also has the potential to identify histological findings at levels beyond what the human eye can see, [ 99 ] and has shown the ability to use genotypic and phenotypic data to more accurately detect the tumor of origin for metastatic cancer. [ 102 ] One of the major current barriers to widespread implementation of AI-assisted pathology tools is the lack of prospective, randomized, multi-center controlled trials in determining the true clinical utility of AI for pathologists and patients, highlighting a current area of need in AI and healthcare research. [ 99 ] Primary care [ edit ] Primary care has become one key development area for AI technologies. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] AI in primary care has been used for supporting decision making, predictive modeling, and business analytics. [ 105 ] There are only a few examples of AI decision support systems that were prospectively assessed on clinical efficacy when used in practice by physicians. But there are cases where the use of these systems yielded a positive effect on treatment choice by physicians. [ 106 ] As of 2022 in relation to elder care, AI robots had been helpful in guiding older residents living in assisted living with entertainment and company. These bots are allowing staff in the home to have more one-on-one time with each resident, but the bots are also programmed with more ability in what they are able to do; such as knowing different languages and different types of care depending on the patient's conditions. The bot is an AI machine, which means it goes through the same training as any other machine - using algorithms to parse the given data, learn from it and predict the outcome in relation to what situation is at hand. [ 107 ] Psychiatry [ edit ] In psychiatry, AI applications are still in a phase of proof-of-concept. [ 108 ] Areas where the evidence is widening quickly include predictive modelling of diagnosis and treatment outcomes, [ 109 ] chatbots, conversational agents that imitate human behaviour and which have been studied for anxiety and depression. [ 110 ] Challenges include the fact that many applications in the field are developed and proposed by private corporations, such as the screening for suicidal ideation implemented by Facebook in 2017. [ 111 ] Such applications outside the healthcare system raise various professional, ethical and regulatory questions. [ 112 ] Another issue is often with the validity and interpretability of the models. Small training datasets contain bias that is inherited by the models, and compromises the generalizability and stability of these models. Such models may also have the potential to be discriminatory against minority groups that are underrepresented in samples. [ 113 ] In 2023, US-based National Eating Disorders Association replaced its human helpline staff with a chatbot but had to take it offline after users reported receiving harmful advice from it. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] Radiology [ edit ] AI is being studied within the field of radiology to detect and diagnose diseases through computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. [ 117 ] It may be particularly useful in settings where demand for human expertise exceeds supply, or where data is too complex to be efficiently interpreted by human readers. [ 118 ] Several deep learning models have shown the capability to be roughly as accurate as healthcare professionals in identifying diseases through medical imaging, though few of the studies reporting these findings have been externally validated. [ 119 ] AI can also provide non-interpretive benefit to radiologists, such as reducing noise in images, creating high-quality images from lower doses of radiation, enhancing MR image quality, [ 120 ] and automatically assessing image quality. [ 121 ] Further research investigating the use of AI in nuclear medicine focuses on image reconstruction, anatomical landmarking, and the enablement of lower doses in imaging studies. [ 122 ] The analysis of images for supervised AI applications in radiology encompasses two primary techniques at present: (1) convolutional neural network-based analysis; and (2) utilization of radiomics . [ 118 ] AI is also used in breast imaging for analyzing screening mammograms and can participate in improving breast cancer detection rate [ 123 ] as well as reducing radiologist's reading workload. Pharmacy [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Artificial intelligence in pharmacy . [ edit ] This article may require copy editing for grammar, style, cohesion, tone, or spelling . You can assist by editing it . ( May 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Part of a series on Artificial intelligence (AI) Major goals Artificial general intelligence Intelligent agent Recursive self-improvement Planning Computer vision General game playing Knowledge representation Natural language processing Robotics AI safety Approaches Machine learning Symbolic Deep learning Bayesian networks Evolutionary algorithms Hybrid intelligent systems Systems integration Applications Bioinformatics Deepfake Earth sciences Finance Generative AI Art Audio Music Government Healthcare Mental health Industry Translation Military Physics Projects Philosophy Artificial consciousness Chinese room Friendly AI Control problem / Takeover Ethics Existential risk Turing test Uncanny valley History Timeline Progress AI winter AI boom Glossary Glossary v t e Artificial Intelligence (AI) [ 124 ] [ 125 ] [ 126 ] is a field of computer science in which a huge amount of data is fed to a machine learning model, which allows the machine to learn patterns from that data and is able to make smart, calculated decisions, which can only be achieved by human intelligence . Artificial intelligence is playing a crucial role in driving the application and research in many fields and pharmacy is no exception. In pharmacy, the use of AI is leading to the discovery, development, and delivery of medications , and also enhancing patient care through personalized treatment plans. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] This article is going to summarize AI's application in drug research, drug safety, dose recommendation and examine the limitations and future directions of AI in pharmacy. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Industry [ edit ] The trend of large health companies merging allows for greater health data accessibility. Greater health data lays the groundwork for the implementation of AI algorithms. A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the clinical decision support systems . As more data is collected, machine learning algorithms adapt and allow for more robust responses and solutions. [ 117 ] Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of big data in the healthcare industry. Many companies investigate the market opportunities through the realms of \"data assessment, storage, management, and analysis technologies\" which are all crucial parts of the healthcare industry. [ 131 ] With the market for AI expanding constantly, large tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Baidu all have their own AI research divisions, as well as millions of dollars allocated for acquisition of smaller AI based companies. [ 131 ] The following are examples of large companies that are contributing to AI algorithms for use in healthcare: Amazon Web Services [ 132 ] Apple [ 132 ] Google 's DeepMind platform is being used by the UK National Health Service to detect certain health risks through data collected via a mobile app. A second project with the NHS involves the analysis of medical images collected from NHS patients to develop computer vision algorithms to detect cancerous tissues. IBM's Watson Oncology is in development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Cleveland Clinic . IBM is also working with CVS Health on AI applications in chronic disease treatment and with Johnson & Johnson on analysis of scientific papers to find new connections for drug development. In May 2017, IBM and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute began a joint project entitled Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning and Semantics (HEALS) , to explore using AI technology to enhance healthcare. Intel's venture capital arm Intel Capital invested in 2016 in the startup Lumiata, which uses AI to identify at-risk patients and develop care options. [ 133 ] Meta [ 132 ] Microsoft 's Hanover project, in partnership with Oregon Health & Science University 's Knight Cancer Institute, analyzes medical research to predict the most effective cancer drug treatment options for patients. Other projects include medical image analysis of tumor progression and the development of programmable cells. [ 134 ] Neuralink has come up with a next-generation neuroprosthetic which intricately interfaces with thousands of neural pathways in the brain. [ 117 ] Their process allows a chip, roughly the size of a quarter, to be inserted in the place of a chunk of a skull by a precision surgical robot to avoid accidental injury . [ 117 ] Elon Musk premiering the surgical robot that implants the Neuralink brain chip Ava Industries Ltd., a Canadian healthcare technology firm, is developing integrated AI tools to support clinical efficiency. Ava has implemented an embedded AI medical scribe within theis electronic medical record system (EMR) and is further developing tools such as an AI chart summarizer and an AI document classifier. [1] The company has received support through grants from Canada Health Infowayfor its work in advancing digital health solutions. [2] Tencent is working on several medical systems and services. These include AI Medical Innovation System (AIMIS) , an AI-powered diagnostic medical imaging service; WeChat Intelligent Healthcare; and Tencent Doctorwork Digital consultant apps use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user's medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution[ buzzword ] to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user (e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus) and value capturing mechanisms (e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders). IFlytek launched a service robot \"Xiao Man\", which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas. [ citation needed ] It also works in the field of medical imaging. Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH (\"Cruzr\") and Softbank Robotics (\"Pepper\"). [ citation needed ] The Indian startup Haptik developed a WhatsApp chatbot in 2021 which answers questions associated with the deadly coronavirus in India . Similarly, a software platform ChatBot in partnership with medtech startup Infermedica launched COVID-19 Risk Assessment ChatBot. [ 135 ] Many automobile manufacturers are beginning to use machine learning healthcare in their cars as well. [ 131 ] Companies such as BMW , GE , Tesla , Toyota , and Volvo all have new research campaigns to find ways of learning a driver's vital statistics to ensure they are awake, paying attention to the road, and not under the influence of substances. [ 131 ] Expanding care to developing nations [ edit ] Artificial intelligence continues to expand in its abilities to diagnose more people accurately in nations where fewer doctors are accessible to the public. Many new technology companies such as SpaceX and the Raspberry Pi Foundation have enabled more developing countries to have access to computers and the internet than ever before. [ 136 ] With the increasing capabilities of AI over the internet, advanced machine learning algorithms can allow patients to get accurately diagnosed when they would previously have no way of knowing if they had a life-threatening disease or not. [ 136 ] Using AI in developing nations that do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can improve patient care. AI can allow for not only diagnosis of patient in areas where healthcare is scarce, but also allow for a good patient experience by resourcing files to find the best treatment for a patient. [ 137 ] The ability of AI to adjust course as it goes also allows the patient to have their treatment modified based on what works for them; a level of individualized care that is nearly non-existent in developing countries. [ 137 ] Regulation [ edit ] This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( May 2025 ) Challenges of the clinical use of AI have brought about a potential need for regulations . AI studies need to be completely and transparently reported to have value to inform regulatory approval. Depending on the phase of study, international consensus-based reporting guidelines (TRIPOD+AI, [ 138 ] DECIDE-AI, [ 139 ] CONSORT-AI [ 140 ] ) have been developed to provide recommendations on the key details that need to be reported. A man speaking at the GDPR compliance workshop at the 2019 Entrepreneurship Summit While regulations exist pertaining to the collection of patient data such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the US ( HIPAA ) and the European General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) pertaining to patients within the EU, health care AI is \u201c\"severely under-regulated worldwide\" as of 2025. [ 132 ] Unclear is whether healthcare AI can be classified merely as software or as medical device . [ 132 ] United Nations (WHO/ITU) [ edit ] The joint ITU - WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H) has built a platform - known as the ITU-WHO AI for Health Framework - for the testing and benchmarking of AI applications in health domain. As of November 2018, eight use cases are being benchmarked, including assessing breast cancer risk from histopathological imagery, guiding anti-venom selection from snake images, and diagnosing skin lesions. USA [ edit ] United States Food & Drug Administration [ 141 ] In 2015, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued rules and regulations to protect the privacy of individuals\u2019 health information, requiring healthcare providers to follow certain privacy rules when using AI, to keep a record of how they use AI and to ensure that their AI systems are secure. [ 142 ] In May 2016, the White House announced its plan to host a series of workshops and formation of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. [ citation needed ] In October 2016, the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, outlining its proposed priorities for Federally-funded AI research and development (within government and academia). The report notes a strategic R&D plan for the subfield of health information technology was in development stages. [ citation needed ] In January 2021, the US FDA published a new Action Plan, entitled Artificial Intelligence (AI) /Machine Learning (ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) Action Plan. [ 143 ] It layed out the FDA's future plans for regulation of medical devices that would include artificial intelligence in their software with five main actions: 1. Tailored Regulatory Framework for Ai/M:-based SaMD, 2. Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP), 3. Patient-Centered Approach Incorporating Transparency to Users, 4. Regulatory Science Methods Related to Algorithm Bias & Robustness, and 5. Real-World Performance(RWP). This plan was in direct response to stakeholders' feedback on a 2019 discussion paper also published by the FDA. [ 143 ] Under President Biden the DHSS and the National Institute of Standards and Technology were instructed to develop regulation of healthcare AI. [ 132 ] According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , the OCR issued guidance on the ethical use of AI in healthcare in 2021. It outlined four core ethical principles that must be followed: respect for autonomy , beneficence (ethics) , non-maleficence , and justice. Respect for autonomy requires that individuals have control over their own data and decisions. Beneficence requires that AI be used to do good, such as improving the quality of care and reducing health disparities. Non-maleficence requires that AI be used to do no harm, such as avoiding discrimination in decisions. Finally, justice requires that AI be used fairly, such as using the same standards for decisions no matter a person's race, gender, or income level. As of March 2021, the OCR had hired a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (OCAIO) to pursue the \"implementation of the HHS AI strategy\". [ 144 ] With the second Trump administration deregulation of health AI began on January 20, 2025 with merely voluntary standards for collecting and sharing data, statutory definitions for algorithmic discrimination, automation bias, and equity being cancelled, cuts to NIST and 19% of FDA workforce eliminated. [ 132 ] Europe [ edit ] Other countries have implemented data protection regulations, more specifically with company privacy invasions. In Denmark, the Danish Expert Group on data ethics has adopted recommendations on 'Data for the Benefit of the People'. These recommendations are intended to encourage the responsible use of data in the business sector, with a focus on data processing. The recommendations include a focus on equality and non-discrimination with regard to bias in AI, as well as human dignity which is to outweigh profit and must be respected in all data processes. [ 145 ] The European Union has implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect citizens' personal data, which applies to the use of AI in healthcare. In addition, the European Commission has established guidelines to ensure the ethical development of AI, including the use of algorithms to ensure fairness and transparency. [ 146 ] With GDPR, the European Union was the first to regulate AI through data protection legislation. The Union finds privacy as a fundamental human right, it wants to prevent unconsented and secondary uses of data by private or public health facilities. By streamlining access to personal data for health research and findings, they are able to instate the right and importance of patient privacy. [ 146 ] In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires organizations to protect the privacy and security of patient information. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have also released guidelines for the development of AI-based medical applications. [ 147 ] In 2025, Europe was leading the USA on AI regulation, while lagging in innovation and at least one California-based biotech company was \"engaging the European Medicines Agency earlier in development than previously anticipated to mitigate concerns about the FDA's ability to meet development timelines.\" [ 132 ] Ethical concerns [ edit ] While research on the use of AI in healthcare aims to validate its efficacy in improving patient outcomes before its broader adoption, its use may introduce several new types of risk to patients and healthcare providers, such as algorithmic bias , Do not resuscitate implications, and other machine morality issues. AI may also compromise the protection of patients' rights, such as the right to informed consent and the right to medical data protection. [ 148 ] Data collection, privacy - autonomy [ edit ] In order to effectively train Machine Learning and use AI in healthcare, massive amounts of data must be gathered. Acquiring this data, however, comes at the cost of patient privacy , i.e. autonomy in most cases and is not well received publicly. For example, a survey conducted in the UK estimated that 63% of the population is uncomfortable with sharing their personal data in order to improve artificial intelligence technology. [ 149 ] The scarcity of real, accessible patient data is a hindrance that deters the progress of developing and deploying more artificial intelligence in healthcare. The lack of regulations surrounding AI in the United States has generated concerns about mismanagement of patient data, such as with corporations utilizing patient data for financial gain. For example, as of 2020 Roche , a Swiss healthcare company, was found to have purchased healthcare data for approximately 2 million cancer patients at an estimated total cost of $1.9 billion. [ 150 ] Naturally, this generates questions of ethical concern; Is there a monetary price that can be set for data, and should it depend on its perceived value or contributions to science? Is it fair to patients to sell their data? These concerns were addressed in a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2022 that asked Americans for their opinions about the increased presence of AI in their daily lives, and the survey estimated that 37% of Americans were more concerned than excited about such increased presence, with 8% of participants specifically associating their concern with \"people misusing AI\". [ 151 ] Ultimately, the current potential of artificial intelligence in healthcare is additionally hindered by concerns about mismanagement of data collected, especially in the United States. Automation- beneficence [ edit ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic , or fulfill beneficence . [ 16 ] According to a 2019 study, AI can replace up to 35% of jobs in the UK within the next 10 to 20 years. [ 152 ] However, of these jobs, it was concluded that AI has not eliminated any healthcare jobs so far. Though if AI were to automate healthcare-related jobs, the jobs most susceptible to automation would be those dealing with digital information, radiology, and pathology, as opposed to those dealing with doctor-to-patient interaction. [ 152 ] Ouutputs can be incorrect or incomplete and diagnosis and recommendations harm people. [ 132 ] Bias, discrimination [ edit ] Since AI makes decisions solely on the data it receives as input, it is important that this data represents accurate patient demographics. In a hospital setting, patients do not have full knowledge of how predictive algorithms are created or calibrated. Therefore, these medical establishments can unfairly code their algorithms to discriminate against minorities and prioritize profits rather than providing optimal care, i.e. violating the ethical principle of social justice or non-maleficence . [ 153 ] A recent scoping review identified 18 equity challenges along with 15 strategies that can be implemented to help address them when AI applications are developed using many-to-many mapping. [ 154 ] There can be unintended bias in algorithms that can exacerbate social and healthcare inequities. [ 153 ] Since AI's decisions are a direct reflection of its input data, the data it receives must have accurate representation of patient demographics. For instance, if populations are less represented in healthcare data it is likely to create bias in AI tools that lead to incorrect assumptions of a demographic and impact the ability to provide appropriate care. [ 155 ] White males are overly represented in medical data sets. [ 156 ] Therefore, having minimal patient data on minorities can lead to AI making more accurate predictions for majority populations, leading to unintended worse medical outcomes for minority populations. [ 157 ] Collecting data from minority communities can also lead to medical discrimination. For instance, HIV is a prevalent virus among minority communities and HIV status can be used to discriminate against patients. [ 156 ] In addition to biases that may arise from sample selection, different clinical systems used to collect data may also impact AI functionality. For example, radiographic systems and their outcomes (e.g., resolution) vary by provider. Moreover, clinician work practices, such as the positioning of the patient for radiography, can also greatly influence the data and make comparability difficult. [ 158 ] However, these biases are able to be eliminated through careful implementation and a methodical collection of representative data. A final source of algorithmic bias , which has been called \"label choice bias\", arises when proxy measures are used to train algorithms, that build in bias against certain groups. For example, a widely used algorithm predicted health care costs as a proxy for health care needs, and used predictions to allocate resources to help patients with complex health needs. This introduced bias because Black patients have lower costs, even when they are just as unhealthy as White patients. [ 159 ] Solutions to the \"label choice bias\" aim to match the actual target (what the algorithm is predicting) more closely to the ideal target (what researchers want the algorithm to predict), so for the prior example, instead of predicting cost, researchers would focus on the variable of healthcare needs which is rather more significant. Adjusting the target led to almost double the number of Black patients being selected for the program. History [ edit ] Research in the 1960s and 1970s produced the first problem-solving program, or expert system , known as Dendral . [ 160 ] [ 161 ] While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry, it provided the basis for a subsequent system MYCIN , [ 162 ] considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine. [ 162 ] [ 163 ] MYCIN and other systems such as INTERNIST-1 and CASNET did not achieve routine use by practitioners, however. [ 164 ] The 1980s and 1990s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity. During this time, there was a recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physicians. [ 165 ] Approaches involving fuzzy set theory, [ 166 ] Bayesian networks , [ 167 ] and artificial neural networks , [ 168 ] [ 169 ] have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare. Medical and technological advancements occurring over this half-century period that have enabled the growth of healthcare-related applications of AI to include: Improvements in computing power resulting in faster data collection and data processing [ 170 ] Growth of genomic sequencing databases [ 171 ] Widespread implementation of electronic health record systems [ 172 ] Improvements in natural language processing and computer vision , enabling machines to replicate human perceptual processes [ 173 ] [ 174 ] Enhanced the precision of robot-assisted surgery [ 175 ] Increased tree-based machine learning models that allow flexibility in establishing health predictors [ 176 ] Improvements in deep learning techniques and data logs for rare diseases See also [ edit ] AI alignment Artificial intelligence in mental health Artificial intelligence Glossary of artificial intelligence Full body scanner (i.e. Dermascanner , ...)

While there are only a handful of practical examples for its medical use with enough evidence, hype around the topic is unprecedented 1 . There is a growing list of publications on the subject in the form of academic articles, health policy reports, statements from professional societies, and popular media coverage (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1: Number of medical A.I. studies by year from 2010 to 2020; and by medical specialties. a The number of studies as found on Pubmed.com using the search term)\u201cmachine learning\u201d OR \u201cdeep learning\u201d) and choosing a year in advanced search. b The same search method was used followed by (AND specialty) without specifying a time frame. The number in the circles determine how many studies we found. Full size image A.I. has been used extensively in industries such as transportation, entertainment or IT during the last decade. It has been used to control self-driving vehicles; to trade on the stock market; social media platforms, web browsers and search engines. It is likely that the reader of this paper used some forms of A.I. today for more than an hour by using services such as Google Maps, Waze, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn or Google Search, among a myriad of others. It has potentials in medicine, drug design and healthcare, yet, the proof and evidence are yet to be convincing enough for the general public and the medical community to adopt the technology 2 . The technology is still in its infancy and more studies are published each year than the year before. There are so many papers, conference talks, misleading news headlines and study interpretations that a short and visual guide any medical professional can refer back to in their professional life might be useful. There is no doubt that A.I. will have a beneficial role in healthcare and can penetrate the boundaries of adoption only if medical professionals serve as knowledgeable and supportive guides and leaders in the process 3 . For this, it is critical that physicians understand the basics of the technology so they can see beyond the hype, evaluate A.I.-based studies and clinical validation; as well as acknowledge the limitations and opportunities A.I. has. This paper aims to serve as a short, visual and digestible repository of information and details every physician might need to know in the age of A.I. We describe the simple definition of A.I., its levels, its methods, the differences between the methods with medical examples, the potential benefits, dangers, challenges of A.I., as well as we attempt at providing a futuristic vision about using it in an everyday medical practice. Definition and levels of A.I. A.I. is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer science, psychology, linguistics, and philosophy, among others. According to its simplest definition, artificial intelligence (A.I.) is intelligence demonstrated by machines. It is sometimes also described as \u201cmachines that mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as learning and problem solving\u201d 4 . Nick Bostrom, philosopher at the University of Oxford, described three major levels in the development of A.I. in his book Superintelligence (Fig. 2 5 ). Fig. 2: Levels of A.I. The three levels of A.I. as defined by Nick Bostrom in Superintelligence. The green dot indicates a theoretical threshold for what the ideal scenario would be. Full size image Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) ANI already has incredible pattern recognizing abilities in huge data sets, which makes it perfect for solving text, voice, or image-based classification and clustering problems. It is an algorithm that can excel at a precisely defined, single task. It can play chess like nobody else ever, yet its IQ is zero. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) one day could have a human being\u2019s comprehensive and total cognitive capacity. This is human level A.I. It can reason, argue, memorize and solve issues like you do Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI) theoretically could have humanity\u2019s combined cognitive capacity or even more. Humanity, obviously, would not be able to grasp its knowledge and understand its reasoning. Many organizations work hard to avoid ever reaching this stage. How does A.I. work? A.I. works through a method called machine learning. As there are challenges and tasks so complicated in healthcare that writing traditional algorithms for solving those was not enough anymore, a new method was needed. Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed 6 . If you feed the algorithm with enough data of good quality, machine learning allows them to create strategies for excelling at that particular task. If I want to write a program that can spot cats on photos, I had better turn to machine learning. The reasons why quickly become clear if you try to devise rules that such a program should be based on. How can you spot a cat in a photo? If you devise features you think easily depict cats such as having two ears, two eyes, four legs and such, you find yourself in a situation where you also have to define all these expressions. What is an ear for a program that only \u201csees\u201d pixels on a photo? Therefore, the most efficient way is to feed a machine learning algorithm with images with cats on them, preferably with cats that have been annotated manually by human beings to make sure the images do contain cats. The more such annotated images we feed the algorithm with, the better it will become at recognizing cats on images. It will not understand what a cat is, but it will certainly recognize what we think are cats in photos like we do with an increasing and ruthless efficiency. No matter what task we aim to solve, we feed the simpler machine learning algorithms with data and constantly iterate how it digests it to become better at solving the task. With more complex algorithms such as neural networks and deep learning, it is possible that the algorithm starts creating its own rules and strategies without human input. From there, not even its developers might understand how it draws a conclusion or the strategy it uses to excel at a task. When it comes to technologies we use to make medical decisions, we like to understand the core of the machine or at least the physical/biological explanations behind it. In the case of advanced A.I.-based algorithms, it seems we will not be able to understand more than the theoretical basics. Real-life examples for the subtypes of machine learning Machine learning has many subtypes and combined methods, but we only feature the three major subtypes besides an advanced method, deep learning (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3: Visual guide to machine and deep learning subtypes. a In supervised learning, the teacher (developer) knows what he wants to teach to the child (A.I.), defines the expected answer and the child learns to excel at the task. b In unsupervised learning, the teacher does not influence how the child learns to play but observes the conclusions the child can draw from solving the task. c In reinforcement learning, the teacher knows what he wants to teach to the child but does not define step-by-step how the child should learn it. Instead, the teacher only gives feedback after the task is completed and asks the child to find out his own strategy using those outcomes the teacher rewarded. d In deep learning, it is possible to analyze vastly more complex data sets from images and videos to a sort of human reasoning. It is multi-layered and could mimic how neural networks in the brain work. Full size image Supervised learning Is used when we can precisely define the task we want the algorithm to learn based on data that we already have. Let\u2019s take the following example. We have two sets of medical records of patients, group A and B. In one set, we have family history, lab markers and other details with the diagnosis. In the other set, we have the same kinds of data but without the diagnosis. We would like to build a model that can learn to assign the right diagnosis to patients in group B based on the associations and labels the algorithm learns about in group A. It is like learning with a teacher because we know exactly what the algorithm should learn, and it is by far the most frequently used training mode. Unsupervised learning Is like learning without a teacher. We have a group of patients with different sets of data, but we do not know their individual diagnoses. We build a model, then to try to cluster patients based on similar attributes such as the symptoms they presented with, their lab markers or age and gender. We might learn new associations we have not looked at before. In another example, it can also be useful in clustering tissue samples based on similar gene expression values; or in finding novel drug-drug interactions. In summary, we devise certain rules, let the algorithm learn by itself and we do not modify the algorithm based on the outcome. Reinforcement learning Allows the algorithm to learn how to complete the tasks with a sequence of decisions by itself without being told how to do it. The teacher is only able to give feedback after a series of actions, not for each item as it does with supervised learning. The model starts performing the task only knowing some basic rules, and after failing or succeeding in completing the task, the teacher weighs in to push it to use the winning strategy more. This way, the program can build its own experiences as it performs the task more and more. It is similar to how we train dogs. When the dog performs or tries to perform a task, we only give it a treat if it performed well. The most famous example for this method is how AlphaZero can learn to become the best player in any 2-players game in hours by playing millions of games against itself. It starts playing a game knowing only its basic rules, and the developers let the algorithm know when it won a match to prioritize that strategy while playing the next game 7 . In an example, authors used this method to determine clinical trial dosing, where the algorithm learnt the appropriate dosing regimen to reduce mean tumor diameters in patients undergoing chemo- and radiation therapy 8 . The main challenge with applying reinforcement learning to healthcare is that we cannot play out a large number of scenarios as the lives of patients are at stake. Machine learning vs traditional statistical models A.I. is a huge domain which includes machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, but also methods that do not even process quantitative data. Therefore, it makes sense to compare machine learning to traditional statistical methods. Traditional statistical models focus on discovering relationships and confidence intervals between data points and outcomes. Compared to this, machine learning methods aim to reach high prediction accuracy with putting less emphasis on whether it is possible to interpret the model. The former often analyses a given dataset for its insights, while the latter is trained on a set of data, evaluated on a second set, and then used on an unseen third. Thus, prediction is key in machine learning to generate otherwise unavailable (e.g., expensive or not yet known) data. Also, machine learning is often better suited for large numbers of input variables (think of images with thousands of pixels), while traditional analysis with statistical models was designed for data with tens of input columns 9 . Machine vs deep learning Machine learning is a broad set of methods, their majority were used even decades before the current A.I. revolution. Most breakthroughs are achieved nowadays with artificial neural networks, but there are several other models, each with its own advantages. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and while it has similar functions, its capabilities are different. Deep learning uses a layered structure of artificial neural networks that is inspired by the neural network of the human brain. The internal structure and number of layers within a neural network is a field of active research, but as a rule of thumb we can say that a deeper net with more layers can learn more complex tasks - at the same time requiring more data and longer time to train. Deep models have the capacity to process images, sound and other high dimensionality data with good results, while other machine learning models may perform better with data organized into a spreadsheet. Looking at a medical example, let\u2019s build a model that can cluster patients by diagnosis based on the data in their medical records. If a medical record contains the expression Type 1 Diabetes, a machine learning model will learn to put all such patients in the Type 1 Diabetes cluster. But a deep learning algorithm could learn with time without human input that patients with medical records that only mention T1D should also be assigned to the same group. Programmers of other machine learning algorithms should add these alternatives themselves. Another example might also demonstrate the power and potentials of deep learning. We would like to build a model that turns on the light if we shout the word dark. A deep learning model, by time, would learn that saying \u201cI can\u2019t see\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s dark here\u201d should also turn on the light. How to evaluate news and studies about A.I.? Hardly a day goes by without promising research papers and studies on how to apply machine and deep learning to medical problems. However, as already just mentioning A.I. makes companies\u2019 prospects better on any market, overhyping and overmarketing what an algorithm can do is an everyday phenomenon. There are still ways that help evaluate research papers and news on A.I. There are some general questions we can ask ourselves while reading medical A.I. papers. (Table 1 ) 10 , 11 . Table 1 A summary of some general questions readers of an A.I. medical paper might want to ask themselves to evaluate the quality of the results of a research. Full size table Besides obvious features such as the quality of the journal the paper was published in (real breakthroughs tend to be able to reach the attention of high-level journals), the most important factor is the source of data. It matters where the data stems from, thus it is worth checking the \u2018Methods\u2019 section where authors describe how, where and what kind of data they received. No algorithm can be trained without a good amount of quality data. Moreover, the size of the dataset also matters: the more images, text or any other source materials the researchers have, the more precise the algorithms can become. Collaborations with clinicians and healthcare institutions are crucial in getting large amounts of quality data. If not, some research groups do tricks on their dataset to make it bigger (e.g., rotate images to double the database size). The reported performance (e.g., precision, speed) of the algorithm should be compared to previously existing solutions and human abilities. Even a state-of-the-art technical solution may perform so much worse than human professionals in a real-world clinical setting, that it may not be helpful at all. It is crucial for such technologies to be evaluated whether they can easily be implemented in clinical protocols, and whether the results are straightforward for the medical staff to interpret. It is also key to see whether the paper analyzed a real clinical problem. An algorithm might perform very well on a pre-selected dataset, however, it should also be tested on real clinical data. DeepMind claimed in its published study that its model was able to accurately predict that a patient will develop acute kidney failure \u201cwithin a clinically actionable window\u201d up to 48\u2009h in advance 12 . While the algorithm did do that, it cannot be clinically validated without testing it prospectively in a clinical setting. Also, when you look at the latest pieces of news on smart algorithms, you should watch out for the following to be able to carefully assess the quality of the given A.I.-related article. The term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d itself might be misleading as due to the overuse of the expression, its meaning started to get inflated. If an announcement or news article mentions A.I. without describing the exact method under it, it is a good sign to be skeptical and careful. A company or a research group should mention a subtype of machine or deep learning and be able to explain the method in detail with which they are aiming to create A.I. In a relevant example that took place in Thailand, a Google-backed algorithm aimed at improving care. There, normally, nurses took photos of the eyes of patients during check-ups and shared those to be analyzed by a specialist elsewhere. This process could take up to 10 weeks. The A.I. developed by Google Health identified signs of diabetic retinopathy from an eye scan with an accuracy of more than 90% and provide a result in less than 10\u2009min. When Google started putting this system into practice, they ran into real-life issues. Sometimes a bad internet connection stopped the whole system from working as all images had to be uploaded to the cloud through a strong connection. If the quality of the scan did not meet a certain threshold, it simply did not give a result (the deep learning algorithm has to be fed with high quality images to get better). This way, nurses had to spend time editing some of the images the algorithm chose not to analyze. Developers had to travel to the site to help sort out these issues 13 . As a summary, the medical journal Radiology proposed a guide for authors, reviewers, and readers for assessing radiology research on artificial intelligence 10 . Other medical associations and journal editorial boards might adopt and customize it too. They also describe a checklist that every author should complete when publishing their A.I. research. Examples for how healthcare could benefit from A.I. In short, tasks that are highly repetitive and involve the analysis of quantifiable data might benefit the most from the use of A.I. We feature a few examples that provide a picture about the whole range of opportunities. Improving in-person and online consultations Babylon Health launched an application that offers A.I.-driven consultation. It uses the patient\u2019s medical history and common medical knowledge. Patients report their symptoms through the app which checks those in a database of diseases using speech recognition. After that, it offers a course of action 14 . Health assistance and medication management The medical start-up Sense.ly developed Molly, a virtual nurse that was designed to have a smiling face coupled with a pleasant voice. Its goal is to help assist patients with monitoring their health or disease management in-between doctor\u2019s visits using ML. It also provides customized follow-up care, with a focus on chronic diseases 15 . A similar approach was used by the AiCure app that uses a smartphone\u2019s camera and A.I. to confirm that patients are adhering to their prescriptions 16 . This could be useful for people with serious medical conditions or participants in clinical trials. A.I.-driven diagnostics In 2020, the FDA approved a software programme from the company Caption Health that allows medical professionals to perform cardiac ultrasound imaging without specialized training. It uses A.I. to provide real-time guidance and also the ability to save images of diagnostic quality. It acts as a \u201cco-pilot\u201d for those performing an ultrasound scan as it was designed to emulate the guidance that an expert sonographer would provide to optimize the image. It gives instructions on how to manipulate the transducer, and provides automated feedback on diagnostic image quality 17 . Mining medical records Collecting, storing, normalizing, and tracking medical records is an obvious step for A.I. As an example, Google Deepmind Health is cooperating with the Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust to improve eye treatment by analyzing retina scans. The images are analyzed by DeepMind\u2019s algorithms resulting in a detailed diagnosis and a so-called \u201curgency score\u201d in about 30\u2009s. The prototype system can detect diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration 18 . Precision medicine The company Deep Genomics aims at identifying patterns in genetic data and medical records of patients trying to link mutations to medical conditions. Oncompass Medicine uses A.I.-based algorithms to match genetic mutations found in patients\u2019 tumor samples with ongoing clinical trials worldwide. This way, patients can receive precisely targeted treatments specific to the kind of cancerous tissue they have. Designing treatment plans IBM Watson developed a software that provides evidence-based treatment options for oncologists. It was designed to analyze both structured and unstructured data in medical records that may contribute to decision-making about treatment pathways. The software combines data from the patient\u2019s medical record with clinical expertise, and research papers to suggest promising treatment plans 19 . There are many similar examples in other specialties. Creating an optimized radiation therapy delivery plan usually takes days. A.I.-based technologies help speed this process, completing the process in a couple of minutes 20 , 21 . Drug creation The way pharmaceutical companies develop new drugs through clinical trials can take several years and can cost billions of dollars. Speeding this up while making it more cost-effective would have an enormous effect on healthcare. The company Atomwise uses supercomputers to root out treatments from a database of molecular structures. They also launched a search for a previously unknown combination of safe and existing medicines and in a few days found two drugs predicted by the company\u2019s A.I. technology which may significantly reduce the infectivity of Ebola. Such analysis typically would have taken months or years 22 . Triage tools It is crucial to be able to predict how severe a patient\u2019s medical condition is to support the early identification of those who are vulnerable and at high-risk, especially in emergency medical services. In a study, authors developed and validated an A.I.-based algorithm using deep learning that accurately predicted the need for the critical care of patients and outperformed the conventional triage tools and early warning scores 23 . In another study, authors analyzed online triage tools from more than 150 000 patient interactions with a chatbot, and they found a decreased level of the urgency of patients\u2019 intended level of care in more than one-quarter of the cases 24 . Both studies indicate that A.I.-based technologies can facilitate triaging even before patients reach the point-of-care. How can an A.I.-based medical technology become part of an everyday practice? The success of A.I. and its place in medicine and healthcare highly depend on whether it can penetrate the boundaries of evidence-based medicine, the lack of policies and reluctance from medical professionals to use it. There is no reason to believe that its use will be able to become common practice without meeting the standards and requirements of previous technologies. However, as the demand for A.I. to be implemented into everyday medicine is getting higher by patients, policy makers, medical professionals and hospitals, its way from developers to practice will have to become faster 25 . A typical example of how it has worked so far is related to Kardia, formerly known as AliveCor. They first made an FDA-approved smartphone case that worked as a single lead ECG in 2012. They launched two clinical trials to test the hardware and the app comparing it to a traditional 12-lead device. Later, the evolution of its design resulted in a credit-card sized device and an even smaller version in 2019. The original device could provide a one channel ECG by playing the user\u2019s fingertips on the sensor for 30\u2009s. The results were uploaded to the cloud to make it accessible for physicians. In 2015, Alivecor received clearance by the FDA to use an algorithm for the analysis of the readings to determine issues related to heart rhythm without human help. By the end of 2017, they already used deep learning networks, and the FDA cleared the company\u2019s ECG reader called KardiaBand as a medical device accessory to the Apple Watch. A study concluded that the device managed to distinguish between atrial fibrillation and a normal heart rhythm with a sensitivity of 93, and a specificity of 94%, respectively. Its sensitivity increased to 99% when a medical professional reviewed the reading 26 . By 2020, products of Alivecor have been tested in over 40 clinical studies. Despite these accomplishments, the use of the device is still not common practice. And as other companies producing A.I.-based medical technologies are lagging behind, it might depict a long period of adoption. A.I. will only reach the status of an everyday medical technology if medical associations provide clear guidelines about implementing it; if policy makers create policies that favor adoption; and if the medical community does not look at A.I. as a threat, but rather, as the stethoscope of the 21st century. What are the major challenges ahead? Examples for ANI do exist today, but there are major issues the A.I. developer and the medical community have to face and tackle before A.I. can become mainstream in medicine. Explainability Medical professionals tend to make decisions using data that were obtained with technologies they either understand or understand the basics enough to trust it. In the case of A.I., it might not be possible. However, millions of learned parameters (the connection weights within the network) determine the output of a deep neural network, which makes it unintuitive to understand the decision process. Even if we visualize the sensitivity of different parts of a network and browse these thousands of noisy images, we will still not see easy-to-grasp learned rules. Reasoning is not a by-product of the algorithm. Thus, explainable A.I. would be crucial in providing insights into A.I.-based algorithms enough to gain trust in them. Augmented intelligence This is a term often promoted by organizations such as the American Medical Association. It focuses on A.I.\u2019s assistive role in healthcare emphasizing that A.I.\u2018s design enhances human intelligence rather than replaces it. It also refers to the value an A.I. can provide that comes from how we can combine the unique capabilities of human experts with those of A.I. to provide better care for patients. A similar term that is related to augmented intelligence is \u201chuman-centered A.I.\u201d which explores the need for the development of A.I.-based systems that learn from and collaborate with humans in a deep and meaningful way. Quality and quantity of data A.I. feeds on data. The more and better quality data it gets access to, the more it can excel at tasks. Advanced algorithms need annotated data to make sure those can learn the task they were designed for. There are medical professionals who act as data annotators which is a time-consuming and monotonous task. Some medical algorithms can only improve through large amounts of annotated data. Therefore the dedicated contribution of data annotators is of crucial importance for the benefit of implementing A.I. in the healthcare setting. Therefore, we can conclude that data annotators are the unsung heroes of the medical A.I. revolution 27 . Privacy issues Medical A.I. needs access to medical records, data from health sensors, medical algorithms, apps and whatever source of information it can learn from. The data can come from healthcare institutions or from individuals. Even if institutions make data anonymized, it was proven in many cases that individual profiles can be traced back. Legal issues and liability What if a deep learning algorithm misses a diagnosis, the doctor accepts the judgment and the patient suffers from the consequences? What if an autonomous surgical robot injures a patient during a procedure? It is an ongoing debate about who will be held liable in the future when robots and A.I., acting autonomously, harm patients. Current consensus states that the professional is open to liability if he or she used the tool in a situation outside the scope of its regulatory approval, or misused it, or applied it despite significant professional doubts of the validity of the evidence surrounding the tool, or with knowledge of the toolmaker obfuscating negative facts. In any other cases, liability falls back on the creators and the companies behind them. Trust We will need a lot of time to trust an autonomous car, to see how it reacts in situations we are familiar with or whether it makes similar decisions in an emergency. Consequently, it will take even more time not only for patients but for medical professionals too to trust A.I. with medical diagnoses, supporting medical decision-making or designing new drugs. This should be taken into consideration when we decide to adopt the technology into the healthcare setting. Biased A.I. A study concluded that commercial companies\u2019 facial-recognition systems were more accurate on lighter-skinned individuals by 11\u201319%. Those produced especially inaccurate results when identifying women of color. In another example, A.I. was implemented in the United States\u2019 criminal justice system in order to predict recidivism. They found that the algorithm predicted disproportionately high probability of black people committing future crimes, no matter how minor their initial offense was. It is not only racial prejudice, but A.I. algorithms also often discriminate against women, minorities, other cultures, or ideologies. For example, Amazon\u2019s HR department had to stop using their A.I.-based machine learning tool which the company developed for sorting out the best job applicants, as it turned out that the smart algorithm favored men. As such algorithms learn from the data they are fed with, A.I. programmers must know about the issue of bias in algorithms and actively fight against it by tailoring them 28 . Patient design When designing algorithms for medical purposes, patients should be involved on the highest level of decision making to make sure their needs are met, and issues and recommendations are built into the technology. An example about its importance is how a start-up developed an algorithm that could detect signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in phone calls of patients in Canada. However, it showed different results with patients who had a French accent. By inviting patients at the early stages of development, such issues could be avoided. As there are positive ongoing efforts for solving each of these, it is still an open question whether those algorithms that become a common part of medical practices would be able to address them all 29 . The future role of A.I. in medicine and healthcar e Every A.I.-based technology that is considered for use in healthcare must be regulated, efficient and backed by evidence 30 . The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been showing an example in achieving a regulatory environment that not only welcomes such innovations but is also able to keep them safe for the public. The FDA launched a branch for digital health in 2019 and has attempted at designing new regulatory standards for A.I.-based technologies. The FDA realized that in the era of A.I., more algorithms will become available than medical devices as there is a shift from hardware to software. As the number of algorithms to be regulated grows exponentially, the current resources of regulatory bodies will not be sufficient for assessing each iteration and update. There have been discussions around a new regulatory framework for modifications to A.I./machine learning-based software as a medical device (SaMD) 31 . This could potentially lead to regulations that make it possible for regulators to assess companies while the companies can roll out algorithms and updates without the need to check them all. This is a viable way of letting A.I.-based technologies become widespread while keeping them safe. Our research group has attempted at creating a constantly updated database of FDA-approved A.I.-based medical technologies. After cross-checking and validating every approval we could find, we identified 64 A.I.-based and, at the same time, FDA approved medical technologies. Only 29 of those (45%) mentioned any A.I.-related terms or expressions in the announcement released by the FDA. Such technologies can only be efficient if they are successfully implemented into the medical practice. The American Medical Association (AMA) has addressed the importance of A.I., has advocated for the use of the expression augmented intelligence, and has assumed thought leadership with its reports and guidelines for physicians. In their AI policy, they state that \u201cas a leader in American medicine, our AMA has a unique opportunity to ensure that the evolution of AI in medicine benefits patients, physicians and the health care community\u201d 32 . To make sure that A.I.-based technologies meet the standards of evidence-based medicine, numerous editorial boards of medical journals and prestigious medical associations such as the WHO or CDC have released their recommendations for the medical community 33 , 34 . One of the potential obstacles in adoption can be a common fear among medical professionals that A.I. will replace them. While highly repetitive and data-based professions, or rather tasks under those professions will probably be highly impacted by automation, the core of the medical profession is and still will be the human touch, empathy and compassionate care; attributes that are almost impossible to mimic through a programming language. However, as a general rule of thumb, we might be able to assume that those medical professionals who use A.I. will replace those who do not do so. That is how such a profound role A.I. will have in the future of medicine. The debate early in the 21st century should not be about whether A.I. takes away the human touch or the art of medicine, but what we should do to improve both with it. When an algorithm using reinforcement learning, thus not being restricted by our human cognitive limitations, comes up with a cure which we could never find with our knowledge about biology, medicine and other life science, the real art of medicine will be to find out and to understand how it did that 35 . With this basic knowledge about the definition, levels, methods, challenges and potentials of A.I., we tried to give an overview about how we can make the medical profession more creative, spending more time with patients than ever.

In this review article, we outline recent breakthroughs in the application of AI in healthcare, describe a roadmap to building effective, reliable and safe AI systems, and discuss the possible future direction of AI augmented healthcare systems. KEYWORDS: AI, digital health Introduction Healthcare systems around the world face significant challenges in achieving the \u2018quadruple aim\u2019 for healthcare: improve population health, improve the patient's experience of care, enhance caregiver experience and reduce the rising cost of care. 1\u20133 Ageing populations, growing burden of chronic diseases and rising costs of healthcare globally are challenging governments, payers, regulators and providers to innovate and transform models of healthcare delivery. Moreover, against a backdrop now catalysed by the global pandemic, healthcare systems find themselves challenged to \u2018perform\u2019 (deliver effective, high-quality care) and \u2018transform\u2019 care at scale by leveraging real-world data driven insights directly into patient care. The pandemic has also highlighted the shortages in healthcare workforce and inequities in the access to care, previously articulated by The King's Fund and the World Health Organization (Box 1 ). 4,5 Box 1. Workforce challenges in the next decade By 2030, the gap between supply of and demand for staff employed by NHS trusts could increase to almost 250,000 full-time equivalent posts. 4 Based on the current trends and needs of the global population by 2030, the world will have 18 million fewer healthcare professionals (especially marked differences in the developing world), including 5 million fewer doctors than society will require. 5 Open in a new tab The application of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has the potential to address some of these supply-and-demand challenges. The increasing availability of multi-modal data (genomics, economic, demographic, clinical and phenotypic) coupled with technology innovations in mobile, internet of things (IoT), computing power and data security herald a moment of convergence between healthcare and technology to fundamentally transform models of healthcare delivery through AI-augmented healthcare systems. In particular, cloud computing is enabling the transition of effective and safe AI systems into mainstream healthcare delivery. Cloud computing is providing the computing capacity for the analysis of considerably large amounts of data, at higher speeds and lower costs compared with historic \u2018on premises\u2019 infrastructure of healthcare organisations. Indeed, we observe that many technology providers are increasingly seeking to partner with healthcare organisations to drive AI-driven medical innovation enabled by cloud computing and technology-related transformation (Box 2 ). 6\u20138 Box 2. Quotes from technology leaders Satya Nadella, chief executive officer, Microsoft: \u2018AI is perhaps the most transformational technology of our time, and healthcare is perhaps AI's most pressing application.\u2019 6 Tim Cook, chief executive officer, Apple: \u2018[Healthcare] is a business opportunity ... if you look at it, medical health activity is the largest or second-largest component of the economy.\u2019 7 Google Health: \u2018We think that AI is poised to transform medicine, delivering new, assistive technologies that will empower doctors to better serve their patients. Machine learning has dozens of possible application areas, but healthcare stands out as a remarkable opportunity to benefit people.\u2019 8 Open in a new tab Here, we summarise recent breakthroughs in the application of AI in healthcare, describe a roadmap to building effective AI systems and discuss the possible future direction of AI augmented healthcare systems. What is artificial intelligence? Simply put, AI refers to the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, through algorithms or a set of rules, which the machine follows to mimic human cognitive functions, such as learning and problem solving. 9 AI systems have the potential to anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up and, as such, operate in an intentional, intelligent and adaptive manner. 10 AI's strength is in its ability to learn and recognise patterns and relationships from large multidimensional and multimodal datasets; for example, AI systems could translate a patient's entire medical record into a single number that represents a likely diagnosis. 11,12 Moreover, AI systems are dynamic and autonomous, learning and adapting as more data become available. 13 AI is not one ubiquitous, universal technology, rather, it represents several subfields (such as machine learning and deep learning) that, individually or in combination, add intelligence to applications. Machine learning (ML) refers to the study of algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience. 14 ML itself may be categorised as \u2018supervised\u2019, \u2018unsupervised\u2019 and \u2018reinforcement learning\u2019 (RL), and there is ongoing research in various sub-fields including \u2018semi-supervised\u2019, \u2018self-supervised\u2019 and \u2018multi-instance\u2019 ML. Supervised learning leverages labelled data (annotated information); for example, using labelled X-ray images of known tumours to detect tumours in new images. 15 \u2018Unsupervised learning\u2019 attempts to extract information from data without labels; for example, categorising groups of patients with similar symptoms to identify a common cause. 16 In RL, computational agents learn by trial and error, or by expert demonstration. The algorithm learns by developing a strategy to maximise rewards. Of note, major breakthroughs in AI in recent years have been based on RL. Deep learning (DL) is a class of algorithms that learns by using a large, many-layered collection of connected processes and exposing these processors to a vast set of examples. DL has emerged as the predominant method in AI today driving improvements in areas such as image and speech recognition. 17,18 How to build effective and trusted AI-augmented healthcare systems? Despite more than a decade of significant focus, the use and adoption of AI in clinical practice remains limited, with many AI products for healthcare still at the design and develop stage. 19\u201322 While there are different ways to build AI systems for healthcare, far too often there are attempts to force square pegs into round holes ie find healthcare problems to apply AI solutions to without due consideration to local context (such as clinical workflows, user needs, trust, safety and ethical implications). We hold the view that AI amplifies and augments, rather than replaces, human intelligence. Hence, when building AI systems in healthcare, it is key to not replace the important elements of the human interaction in medicine but to focus it, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of that interaction. Moreover, AI innovations in healthcare will come through an in-depth, human-centred understanding of the complexity of patient journeys and care pathways. In Fig 1 , we describe a problem-driven, human-centred approach, adapted from frameworks by Wiens et al , Care and Sendak to building effective and reliable AI-augmented healthcare systems. 23\u201325 Fig 1. Open in a new tab Multi-step, iterative approach to build effective and reliable AI-augmented systems in healthcare. Design and develop The first stage is to design and develop AI solutions for the right problems using a human-centred AI and experimentation approach and engaging appropriate stakeholders, especially the healthcare users themselves. Stakeholder engagement and co-creation Build a multidisciplinary team including computer and social scientists, operational and research leadership, and clinical stakeholders (physician, caregivers and patients) and subject experts (eg for biomedical scientists) that would include authorisers, motivators, financiers, conveners, connectors, implementers and champions. 26 A multi-stakeholder team brings the technical, strategic, operational expertise to define problems, goals, success metrics and intermediate milestones. Human-centred AI A human-centred AI approach combines an ethnographic understanding of health systems, with AI. Through user-designed research, first understand the key problems (we suggest using a qualitative study design to understand \u2018what is the problem\u2019, \u2018why is it a problem\u2019, \u2018to whom does it matter\u2019, \u2018why has it not been addressed before\u2019 and \u2018why is it not getting attention\u2019) including the needs, constraints and workflows in healthcare organisations, and the facilitators and barriers to the integration of AI within the clinical context. After defining key problems, the next step is to identify which problems are appropriate for AI to solve, whether there is availability of applicable datasets to build and later evaluate AI. By contextualising algorithms in an existing workflow, AI systems would operate within existing norms and practices to ensure adoption, providing appropriate solutions to existing problems for the end user. Experimentation The focus should be on piloting of new stepwise experiments to build AI tools, using tight feedback loops from stakeholders to facilitate rapid experiential learning and incremental changes. 27 The experiments would allow the trying out of new ideas simultaneously, exploring to see which one works, learn what works and what doesn't, and why. 28 Experimentation and feedback will help to elucidate the purpose and intended uses for the AI system: the likely end users and the potential harm and ethical implications of AI system to them (for instance, data privacy, security, equity and safety). Evaluate and validate Next, we must iteratively evaluate and validate the predictions made by the AI tool to test how well it is functioning. This is critical, and evaluation is based on three dimensions: statistical validity, clinical utility and economic utility. Statistical validity is understanding the performance of AI on metrics of accuracy, reliability, robustness, stability and calibration. High model performance on retrospective, in silico settings is not sufficient to demonstrate clinical utility or impact. To determine clinical utility, evaluate the algorithm in a real-time environment on a hold-out and temporal validation set (eg longitudinal and external geographic datasets) to demonstrate clinical effectiveness and generalisability. 25 Economic utility quantifies the net benefit relative to the cost from the investment in the AI system. Scale and diffuse Many AI systems are initially designed to solve a problem at one healthcare system based on the patient population specific to that location and context. Scale up of AI systems requires special attention to deployment modalities, model updates, the regulatory system, variation between systems and reimbursement environment. Monitor and maintain Even after an AI system has been deployed clinically, it must be continually monitored and maintained to monitor for risks and adverse events using effective post-market surveillance. Healthcare organisations, regulatory bodies and AI developers should cooperate to collate and analyse the relevant datasets for AI performance, clinical and safety-related risks, and adverse events. 29 What are the current and future use cases of AI in healthcare? AI can enable healthcare systems to achieve their \u2018quadruple aim\u2019 by democratising and standardising a future of connected and AI augmented care, precision diagnostics, precision therapeutics and, ultimately, precision medicine (Table 1 ). 30 Research in the application of AI healthcare continues to accelerate rapidly, with potential use cases being demonstrated across the healthcare sector (both physical and mental health) including drug discovery, virtual clinical consultation, disease diagnosis, prognosis, medication management and health monitoring. Table 1.

We describe a non-exhaustive suite of AI applications in healthcare in the near term, medium term and longer term, for the potential capabilities of AI to augment, automate and transform medicine. AI today (and in the near future) Currently, AI systems are not reasoning engines ie cannot reason the same way as human physicians, who can draw upon \u2018common sense\u2019 or \u2018clinical intuition and experience\u2019. 12 Instead, AI resembles a signal translator, translating patterns from datasets. AI systems today are beginning to be adopted by healthcare organisations to automate time consuming, high volume repetitive tasks. Moreover, there is considerable progress in demonstrating the use of AI in precision diagnostics (eg diabetic retinopathy and radiotherapy planning). AI in the medium term (the next 5\u201310 years) In the medium term, we propose that there will be significant progress in the development of powerful algorithms that are efficient (eg require less data to train), able to use unlabelled data, and can combine disparate structured and unstructured data including imaging, electronic health data, multi-omic, behavioural and pharmacological data. In addition, healthcare organisations and medical practices will evolve from being adopters of AI platforms, to becoming co-innovators with technology partners in the development of novel AI systems for precision therapeutics. AI in the long term (>10 years) In the long term, AI systems will become more intelligent , enabling AI healthcare systems achieve a state of precision medicine through AI-augmented healthcare and connected care. Healthcare will shift from the traditional one-size-fits-all form of medicine to a preventative, personalised, data-driven disease management model that achieves improved patient outcomes (improved patient and clinical experiences of care) in a more cost-effective delivery system. Connected/augmented care AI could significantly reduce inefficiency in healthcare, improve patient flow and experience, and enhance caregiver experience and patient safety through the care pathway; for example, AI could be applied to the remote monitoring of patients (eg intelligent telehealth through wearables/sensors) to identify and provide timely care of patients at risk of deterioration. In the long term, we expect that healthcare clinics, hospitals, social care services, patients and caregivers to be all connected to a single, interoperable digital infrastructure using passive sensors in combination with ambient intelligence. 31 Following are two AI applications in connected care. Virtual assistants and AI chatbots AI chatbots (such as those used in Babylon ( www.babylonhealth.com ) and Ada ( https://ada.com )) are being used by patients to identify symptoms and recommend further actions in community and primary care settings. AI chatbots can be integrated with wearable devices such as smartwatches to provide insights to both patients and caregivers in improving their behaviour, sleep and general wellness. Ambient and intelligent care We also note the emergence of ambient sensing without the need for any peripherals. Emerald ( www.emeraldinno.com ): a wireless, touchless sensor and machine learning platform for remote monitoring of sleep, breathing and behaviour, founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and researchers. Google nest: claiming to monitor sleep (including sleep disturbances like cough) using motion and sound sensors. 32 A recently published article exploring the ability to use smart speakers to contactlessly monitor heart rhythms. 33 Automation and ambient clinical intelligence: AI systems leveraging natural language processing (NLP) technology have the potential to automate administrative tasks such as documenting patient visits in electronic health records, optimising clinical workflow and enabling clinicians to focus more time on caring for patients (eg Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience ( www.nuance.com/healthcare/ambient-clinical-intelligence.html )). Precision diagnostics Diagnostic imaging The automated classification of medical images is the leading AI application today. A recent review of AI/ML-based medical devices approved in the USA and Europe from 2015\u20132020 found that more than half (129 (58%) devices in the USA and 126 (53%) devices in Europe) were approved or CE marked for radiological use. 34 Studies have demonstrated AI's ability to meet or exceed the performance of human experts in image-based diagnoses from several medical specialties including pneumonia in radiology (a convolutional neural network trained with labelled frontal chest X-ray images outperformed radiologists in detecting pneumonia), dermatology (a convolutional neural network was trained with clinical images and was found to classify skin lesions accurately), pathology (one study trained AI algorithms with whole-slide pathology images to detect lymph node metastases of breast cancer and compared the results with those of pathologists) and cardiology (a deep learning algorithm diagnosed heart attack with a performance comparable with that of cardiologists). 35\u201338 We recognise that there are some exemplars in this area in the NHS (eg University of Leeds Virtual Pathology Project and the National Pathology Imaging Co-operative) and expect widescale adoption and scaleup of AI-based diagnostic imaging in the medium term. 39 We provide two use cases of such technologies. Diabetic retinopathy screening Key to reducing preventable, diabetes-related vision loss worldwide is screening individuals for detection and the prompt treatment of diabetic retinopathy. However, screening is costly given the substantial number of diabetes patients and limited manpower for eye care worldwide. 40 Research studies on automated AI algorithms for diabetic retinopathy in the USA, Singapore, Thailand and India have demonstrated robust diagnostic performance and cost effectiveness. 41\u201344 Moreover, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved Medicare reimbursement for the use of Food and Drug Administration approved AI algorithm \u2018IDx-DR\u2019, which demonstrated 87% sensitivity and 90% specificity for detecting more-than-mild diabetic retinopathy. 45 Improving the precision and reducing waiting timings for radiotherapy planning An important AI application is to assist clinicians for image preparation and planning tasks for radiotherapy cancer treatment. Currently, segmentation of the images is time consuming and laborious task, performed manually by an oncologist using specially designed software to draw contours around the regions of interest. The AI-based InnerEye open-source technology can cut this preparation time for head and neck, and prostate cancer by up to 90%, meaning that waiting times for starting potentially life-saving radiotherapy treatment can be dramatically reduced (Fig 2 ). 46,47 Fig 2. Open in a new tab Potential applications for the InnerEye deep learning toolkit include quantitative radiology for monitoring tumour progression, planning for surgery and radiotherapy planning. 47 Precision therapeutics To make progress towards precision therapeutics, we need to considerably improve our understanding of disease. Researchers globally are exploring the cellular and molecular basis of disease, collecting a range of multimodal datasets that can lead to digital and biological biomarkers for diagnosis, severity and progression. Two important future AI applications include immunomics / synthetic biology and drug discovery. Immunomics and synthetic biology Through the application of AI tools on multimodal datasets in the future, we may be able to better understand the cellular basis of disease and the clustering of diseases and patient populations to provide more targeted preventive strategies, for example, using immunomics to diagnose and better predict care and treatment options. This will be revolutionary for multiple standards of care, with particular impact in the cancer, neurological and rare disease space, personalising the experience of care for the individual. AI-driven drug discovery AI will drive significant improvement in clinical trial design and optimisation of drug manufacturing processes, and, in general, any combinatorial optimisation process in healthcare could be replaced by AI. We have already seen the beginnings of this with the recent announcements by DeepMind and AlphaFold, which now sets the stage for better understanding disease processes, predicting protein structures and developing more targeted therapeutics (for both rare and more common diseases; Fig 3 ). 48,49 Fig 3. Open in a new tab An overview of the main neural network model architecture for AlphaFold. 49 MSA = multiple sequence alignment. Precision medicine New curative therapies Over the past decade, synthetic biology has produced developments like CRISPR gene editing and some personalised cancer therapies. However, the life cycle for developing such advanced therapies is still extremely inefficient and expensive. In future, with better access to data (genomic, proteomic, glycomic, metabolomic and bioinformatic), AI will allow us to handle far more systematic complexity and, in turn, help us transform the way we understand, discover and affect biology. This will improve the efficiency of the drug discovery process by helping better predict early which agents are more likely to be effective and also better anticipate adverse drug effects, which have often thwarted the further development of otherwise effective drugs at a costly late stage in the development process. This, in turn will democratise access to novel advanced therapies at a lower cost. AI empowered healthcare professionals In the longer term, healthcare professionals will leverage AI in augmenting the care they provide, allowing them to provide safer, standardised and more effective care at the top of their licence; for example, clinicians could use an \u2018AI digital consult\u2019 to examine \u2018digital twin\u2019 models of their patients (a truly \u2018digital and biomedical\u2019 version of a patient), allowing them to \u2018test\u2019 the effectiveness, safety and experience of an intervention (such as a cancer drug) in the digital environment prior to delivering the intervention to the patient in the real world. Challenges We recognise that there are significant challenges related to the wider adoption and deployment of AI into healthcare systems. These challenges include, but are not limited to, data quality and access, technical infrastructure, organisational capacity, and ethical and responsible practices in addition to aspects related to safety and regulation. Some of these issues have been covered, but others go beyond the scope of this current article. Conclusion and key recommendations Advances in AI have the potential to transform many aspects of healthcare, enabling a future that is more personalised, precise, predictive and portable. It is unclear if we will see an incremental adoption of new technologies or radical adoption of these technological innovations, but the impact of such technologies and the digital renaissance they bring requires health systems to consider how best they will adapt to the changing landscape. For the NHS, the application of such technologies truly has the potential to release time for care back to healthcare professionals, enabling them to focus on what matters to their patients and, in the future, leveraging a globally democratised set of data assets comprising the \u2018highest levels of human knowledge\u2019 to \u2018work at the limits of science\u2019 to deliver a common high standard of care, wherever and whenever it is delivered, and by whoever. 50 Globally, AI could become a key tool for improving health equity around the world. As much as the last 10 years have been about the roll out of digitisation of health records for the purposes of efficiency (and in some healthcare systems, billing/reimbursement), the next 10 years will be about the insight and value society can gain from these digital assets, and how these can be translated into driving better clinical outcomes with the assistance of AI, and the subsequent creation of novel data assets and tools. It is clear that we are at an turning point as it relates to the convergence of the practice of medicine and the application of technology, and although there are multiple opportunities, there are formidable challenges that need to be overcome as it relates to the real world and the scale of implementation of such innovation. A key to delivering this vision will be an expansion of translational research in the field of healthcare applications of artificial intelligence. Alongside this, we need investment into the upskilling of a healthcare workforce and future leaders that are digitally enabled, and to understand and embrace, rather than being intimidated by, the potential of an AI-augmented healthcare system. Healthcare leaders should consider (as a minimum) these issues when planning to leverage AI for health: processes for ethical and responsible access to data: healthcare data is highly sensitive, inconsistent, siloed and not optimised for the purposes of machine learning development, evaluation, implementation and adoption access to domain expertise / prior knowledge to make sense and create some of the rules which need to be applied to the datasets (to generate the necessary insight) access to sufficient computing power to generate decisions in real time, which is being transformed exponentially with the advent of cloud computing research into implementation: critically, we must consider, explore and research issues which arise when you take the algorithm and put it in the real world, building \u2018trusted\u2019 AI algorithms embedded into appropriate workflows.

In some cases, it can exceed or augment human capabilities by providing better or faster ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] As the widespread use of AI in healthcare is still relatively new, research is ongoing into its applications across various medical subdisciplines and related industries. AI programs are being applied to practices such as diagnostics , [ 4 ] treatment protocol development, [ 5 ] drug development , [ 6 ] personalized medicine , [ 7 ] and patient monitoring and care. [ 8 ] Since radiographs are the most commonly performed imaging tests in radiology, the potential for AI to assist with triage and interpretation of radiographs is particularly significant. [ 9 ] Using AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy , automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases . [ 10 ] Furthermore, new technologies such as AI are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption. [ 11 ] In contrast, there are also several cases where AI has been put to use in healthcare without proper testing. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic. [ 16 ] Moreover, meta-studies have found that the scientific literature on AI in healthcare often suffers from a lack of reproducibility . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Applications in healthcare systems [ edit ] Disease diagnosis [ edit ] Accurate and early diagnosis of diseases is still a challenge in healthcare. Recognizing medical conditions and their symptoms is a complex problem. AI can assist clinicians with its data processing capabilities to save time and improve accuracy. [ 21 ] Through the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence can be able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the analysis of mass electronic health records (EHRs). [ 22 ] AI can help early prediction, for example, of Alzheimer's disease and dementias , by looking through large numbers of similar cases and possible treatments. [ 23 ] AI can aid doctors' decision-making in emergency cases, for example, in emergency departments. AI algorithms may assist in prioritizing critical cases, cutting down waiting times. Also, AI-backed decision support systems make recommendations instantly and enable quicker interpretation of data, which supports healthcare professionals' decisions. [ 21 ] In 2023 a study reported higher satisfaction rates with ChatGPT -generated responses compared with those from physicians for medical questions posted on Reddit \u2019s r/AskDocs. [ 24 ] Evaluators preferred ChatGPT's responses to physician responses in 78.6% of 585 evaluations, noting better quality and empathy. The authors noted that these were isolated questions taken from an online forum, not in the context of an established patient-physician relationship. [ 24 ] Moreover, responses were not graded on the accuracy of medical information, and some have argued that the experiment was not properly blinded , with the evaluators being coauthors of the study. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Recent developments in statistical physics , machine learning , and inference algorithms are also being explored for their potential in improving medical diagnostic approaches. [ 28 ] Also, the establishment of large healthcare-related data warehouses of sometimes hundreds of millions of patients provides extensive training data for AI models. [ 29 ] Electronic health records [ edit ] Electronic health records (EHR) are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. Now that around 80% of medical practices use EHR, some anticipate the use of artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians. [ 30 ] One application uses natural language processing (NLP) to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms. [ 30 ] For example, the term heart attack and myocardial infarction mean the same things, but physicians may use one over the other based on personal preferences. [ 30 ] NLP algorithms consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed. [ 30 ] Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician's notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read. [ 30 ] Other applications use concept processing to analyze the information entered by the current patient's doctor to present similar cases and help the physician remember to include all relevant details. [ 31 ] Beyond making content edits to an EHR, there are AI algorithms that evaluate an individual patient's record and predict a risk for a disease based on their previous information and family history. [ 32 ] One general algorithm is a rule-based system that makes decisions similarly to how humans use flow charts. [ 33 ] This system takes in large amounts of data and creates a set of rules that connect specific observations to concluded diagnoses. [ 33 ] Thus, the algorithm can take in a new patient's data and try to predict the likeliness that they will have a certain condition or disease. [ 33 ] Since the algorithms can evaluate a patient's information based on collective data, they can find any outstanding issues to bring to a physician's attention and save time. [ 32 ] One study conducted by the Centerstone research institute found that predictive modeling of EHR data has achieved 70\u201372% accuracy in predicting individualized treatment response. [ 34 ] These methods are helpful due to the fact that the amount of online health records doubles every five years. [ 32 ] Physicians do not have the bandwidth to process all this data manually, and AI can leverage this data to assist physicians in treating their patients. [ 32 ] Drug interactions [ edit ] Improvements in natural language processing led to the development of algorithms to identify drug-drug interactions in medical literature. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Drug-drug interactions pose a threat to those taking multiple medications simultaneously, and the danger increases with the number of medications being taken. [ 39 ] To address the difficulty of tracking all known or suspected drug-drug interactions, machine learning algorithms have been created to extract information on interacting drugs and their possible effects from medical literature. Efforts were consolidated in 2013 in the DDIExtraction Challenge, in which a team of researchers at Carlos III University assembled a corpus of literature on drug-drug interactions to form a standardized test for such algorithms. [ 40 ] Competitors were tested on their ability to accurately determine, from the text, which drugs were shown to interact and what the characteristics of their interactions were. [ 41 ] Researchers continue to use this corpus to standardize the measurement of the effectiveness of their algorithms. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 38 ] Other algorithms identify drug-drug interactions from patterns in user-generated content , especially electronic health records and/or adverse event reports. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Organizations such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the World Health Organization's VigiBase allow doctors to submit reports of possible negative reactions to medications. Deep learning algorithms have been developed to parse these reports and detect patterns that imply drug-drug interactions. [ 42 ] Telemedicine [ edit ] An elderly man using a pulse oximeter to measure his blood oxygen levels The increase of telemedicine , the treatment of patients remotely, has shown the rise of possible AI applications. [ 43 ] AI can assist in caring for patients remotely by monitoring their information through sensors. [ 44 ] A wearable device may allow for constant monitoring of a patient and the ability to notice changes that may be less distinguishable by humans. The information can be compared to other data that has already been collected using artificial intelligence algorithms that alert physicians if there are any issues to be aware of. [ 44 ] Another application of artificial intelligence is chat-bot therapy. Some researchers charge that the reliance on chatbots for mental healthcare does not offer the reciprocity and accountability of care that should exist in the relationship between the consumer of mental healthcare and the care provider (be it a chat-bot or psychologist), though. [ 45 ] Some examples of these chatbots include Woebot, Earkick and Wysa. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Since the average age has risen due to a longer life expectancy, artificial intelligence could be useful in helping take care of older populations. [ 49 ] Tools such as environment and personal sensors can identify a person's regular activities and alert a caretaker if a behavior or a measured vital is abnormal. [ 49 ] Although the technology is useful, there are also discussions about limitations of monitoring in order to respect a person's privacy since there are technologies that are designed to map out home layouts and detect human interactions. [ 49 ] Workload management [ edit ] AI has the potential to streamline care coordination and reduce the workload. AI algorithms can automate administrative tasks, prioritize patient needs and facilitate seamless communication in a healthcare team. [ 50 ] This enables healthcare providers to focus more on direct patient care and ensures the efficient and coordinated delivery of healthcare services. Clinical applications [ edit ] Cardiovascular [ edit ] Artificial intelligence algorithms have shown promising results in accurately diagnosing and risk stratifying patients with concern for coronary artery disease, showing potential as an initial triage tool. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Other algorithms have been used in predicting patient mortality, medication effects, and adverse events following treatment for acute coronary syndrome . [ 51 ] Wearables, smartphones, and internet-based technologies have also shown the ability to monitor patients' cardiac data points, expanding the amount of data and the various settings AI models can use and potentially enabling earlier detection of cardiac events occurring outside of the hospital. [ 53 ] A research in 2019 found that AI can be used to predict heart attack with up to 90% accuracy. [ 54 ] Another growing area of research is the utility of AI in classifying heart sounds and diagnosing valvular disease . [ 55 ] Challenges of AI in cardiovascular medicine have included the limited data available to train machine learning models, such as limited data on social determinants of health as they pertain to cardiovascular disease . [ 56 ] A key limitation in early studies evaluating AI were omissions of data comparing algorithmic performance to humans. Examples of studies which assess AI performance relative to physicians includes how AI is non-inferior to humans in interpretation of cardiac echocardiograms [ 57 ] and that AI can diagnose heart attack better than human physicians in the emergency setting, reducing both low-value testing and missed diagnoses. [ 58 ] In cardiovascular tissue engineering and organoid studies, AI is increasingly used to analyze microscopy images, and integrate electrophysiological read outs. [ 59 ] Dermatology [ edit ] Medical imaging (such as X-ray and photography) is a commonly used tool in dermatology [ 60 ] and the development of deep learning has been strongly tied to image\u00a0processing . Therefore, there is a natural fit between the dermatology and deep learning. Machine learning learning holds great potential to process these images for better diagnoses. [ 61 ] Han et al. showed keratinocytic skin cancer detection from face photographs. [ 62 ] Esteva et al. demonstrated dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer from lesion images. [ 63 ] Noyan et al. demonstrated a convolutional neural network that achieved 94% accuracy at identifying skin cells from microscopic Tzanck smear images. [ 64 ] A concern raised with this work is that it has not engaged with disparities related to skin color or differential treatment of patients with non-white skin tones. [ 65 ] According to some researchers, AI algorithms have been shown to be more effective than dermatologists at identifying cancer. [ 66 ] However, a 2021 review article found that a majority of papers analyzing the performance of AI algorithms designed for skin cancer classification failed to use external test sets. [ 67 ] Only four research studies were found in which the AI algorithms were tested on clinics, regions, or populations distinct from those it was trained on, and in each of those four studies, the performance of dermatologists was found to be on par with that of the algorithm. Moreover, only one study [ 68 ] was set in the context of a full clinical examination; others were based on interaction through web-apps or online questionnaires, with most based entirely on context-free images of lesions. In this study, it was found that dermatologists significantly outperformed the algorithms. Many articles claiming superior performance of AI algorithms also fail to distinguish between trainees and board-certified dermatologists in their analyses. [ 67 ] It has also been suggested that AI could be used to automatically evaluate the outcome of maxillo-facial surgery or cleft palate therapy in regard to facial attractiveness or age appearance. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Gastroenterology [ edit ] AI can play a role in various facets of the field of gastroenterology . Endoscopic exams such as esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD) and colonoscopies rely on rapid detection of abnormal tissue. By enhancing these endoscopic procedures with AI, clinicians can more rapidly identify diseases, determine their severity, and visualize blind spots. Early trials in using AI detection systems of early stomach cancer have shown sensitivity close to expert endoscopists. [ 71 ] AI can assist doctors treating ulcerative colitis in detecting the microscopic activity of the disease in people and predicting when flare-ups will happen. For example, an AI-powered tool  was developed to analyse digitised bowel samples ( biopsies ). The tool was able to distinguish with 80% accuracy between samples that show remission of colitis and those with active disease. It also predicted the risk of a flare-up happening with the same accuracy. These rates of successfully using microscopic disease activity to predict disease flare are similar to the accuracy of pathologists . [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Obstetrics and gynaecology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence utilises massive amounts of data to help with predicting illness, prevention, and diagnosis, as well as patient monitoring. In obstetrics, artificial intelligence is utilized in magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and foetal cardiotocography. AI contributes in the resolution of a variety of obstetrical diagnostic issues. [ 74 ] Infectious diseases [ edit ] AI has shown potential in both the laboratory and clinical spheres of infectious disease medicine. [ 75 ] During the COVID-19 pandemic , AI has been used for early detection, tracking virus spread and analysing virus behaviour, among other things. [ 76 ] However, there were only a few examples of AI being used directly in clinical practice during the pandemic itself. [ 77 ] Other applications  of AI around infectious diseases include support-vector machines identifying antimicrobial resistance , machine learning analysis of blood smears to detect malaria , and improved point-of-care testing of Lyme disease based on antigen detection. Additionally, AI has been investigated for improving diagnosis of meningitis , sepsis , and tuberculosis , as well as predicting treatment complications in hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients. [ 75 ] Musculoskeletal [ edit ] AI has been used to identify causes of knee pain that doctors miss, that disproportionately affect Black patients. [ 78 ] Underserved populations experience higher levels of pain. These disparities persist even after controlling for the objective severity of diseases like osteoarthritis, as graded by human physicians using medical images, raising the possibility that underserved patients\u2019 pain stems from factors external to the knee, such as stress. Researchers have conducted a study using a machine-learning algorithm to show that standard radiographic measures of severity overlook objective but undiagnosed features that disproportionately affect diagnosis and management of underserved populations with knee pain. They proposed that new algorithmic measure ALG-P could potentially enable expanded access to treatments for underserved patients. [ 79 ] Neurology [ edit ] The use of AI technologies has been explored for use in the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For diagnostic purposes, machine learning models have been developed that rely on structural MRI inputs. [ 80 ] The input datasets for these models are drawn from databases such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. [ 81 ] Researchers have developed models that rely on convolutional neural networks with the aim of improving early diagnostic accuracy. [ 82 ] Generative adversarial networks are a form of deep learning that have also performed well in diagnosing AD. [ 83 ] There have also been efforts to develop machine learning models into forecasting tools that can predict the prognosis of patients with AD. Forecasting patient outcomes through generative models has been proposed by researchers as a means of synthesizing training and validation sets. [ 84 ] They suggest that generated patient forecasts could be used to provide future models larger training datasets than current open access databases. Oncology [ edit ] AI has been explored for use in cancer diagnosis, risk stratification, molecular characterization of tumors, and cancer drug discovery. A particular challenge in oncologic care that AI is being developed to address is the ability to accurately predict which treatment protocols will be best suited for each patient based on their individual genetic, molecular, and tumor-based characteristics. [ 85 ] AI has been trialed in cancer diagnostics with the reading of imaging studies and pathology slides. [ 86 ] In January 2020, Google DeepMind announced an algorithm capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer detection in screening scans. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] A number of researchers, including Trevor Hastie , Joelle Pineau , and Robert Tibshirani among others, published a reply claiming that DeepMind's research publication in Nature lacked key details on methodology and code, \"effectively undermin[ing] its scientific value\" and making it impossible for the scientific community to confirm the work. [ 89 ] In the MIT Technology Review , author Benjamin Haibe-Kains characterized DeepMind's work as \"an advertisement\" having little to do with science. [ 90 ] In July 2020, it was reported that an AI algorithm developed by the University of Pittsburgh achieves the highest accuracy to date in identifying prostate cancer , with 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] In 2023 a study reported the use of AI for CT -based radiomics classification at grading the aggressiveness of retroperitoneal sarcoma with 82% accuracy compared with 44% for lab analysis of biopsies. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Ophthalmology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence-enhanced technology is being used as an aid in the screening of eye disease and prevention of blindness. [ 95 ] In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the marketing of the first medical device to diagnose a specific type of eye disease, diabetic retinopathy using an artificial intelligence algorithm. [ 96 ] Moreover, AI technology may be used to further improve \"diagnosis rates\" because of the potential to decrease detection time. [ 97 ] Pathology [ edit ] Further information: Digital pathology Ki67 stain calculation by the open-source software QuPath in a pure seminoma, which gives a measure of the proliferation rate of the tumor. The colors represent the intensity of expression: blue-no expression, yellow-low, orange-moderate, and red-high expression. [ 98 ] For many diseases, pathological analysis of cells and tissues is considered to be the gold standard of disease diagnosis. Methods of digital pathology allows microscopy slides to be scanned and digitally analyzed. AI-assisted pathology tools have been developed to assist with the diagnosis of a number of diseases, including breast cancer, hepatitis B, gastric cancer , and colorectal cancer . AI has also been used to predict genetic mutations and prognosticate disease outcomes. [ 71 ] AI is well-suited for use in low-complexity pathological analysis of large-scale screening samples, such as colorectal or breast cancer screening, thus lessening the burden on pathologists and allowing for faster turnaround of sample analysis. [ 99 ] Several deep learning and artificial neural network models have shown accuracy similar to that of human pathologists, [ 99 ] and a study of deep learning assistance in diagnosing metastatic breast cancer in lymph nodes showed that the accuracy of humans with the assistance of a deep learning program was higher than either the humans alone or the AI program alone. [ 100 ] Additionally, implementation of digital pathology is predicted to save over $12 million for a university center over the course of five years, [ 101 ] though savings attributed to AI specifically have not yet been widely researched. The use of augmented and virtual reality could prove to be a stepping stone to wider implementation of AI-assisted pathology, as they can highlight areas of concern on a pathology sample and present them in real-time to a pathologist for more efficient review. [ 99 ] AI also has the potential to identify histological findings at levels beyond what the human eye can see, [ 99 ] and has shown the ability to use genotypic and phenotypic data to more accurately detect the tumor of origin for metastatic cancer. [ 102 ] One of the major current barriers to widespread implementation of AI-assisted pathology tools is the lack of prospective, randomized, multi-center controlled trials in determining the true clinical utility of AI for pathologists and patients, highlighting a current area of need in AI and healthcare research. [ 99 ] Primary care [ edit ] Primary care has become one key development area for AI technologies. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] AI in primary care has been used for supporting decision making, predictive modeling, and business analytics. [ 105 ] There are only a few examples of AI decision support systems that were prospectively assessed on clinical efficacy when used in practice by physicians. But there are cases where the use of these systems yielded a positive effect on treatment choice by physicians. [ 106 ] As of 2022 in relation to elder care, AI robots had been helpful in guiding older residents living in assisted living with entertainment and company. These bots are allowing staff in the home to have more one-on-one time with each resident, but the bots are also programmed with more ability in what they are able to do; such as knowing different languages and different types of care depending on the patient's conditions. The bot is an AI machine, which means it goes through the same training as any other machine - using algorithms to parse the given data, learn from it and predict the outcome in relation to what situation is at hand. [ 107 ] Psychiatry [ edit ] In psychiatry, AI applications are still in a phase of proof-of-concept. [ 108 ] Areas where the evidence is widening quickly include predictive modelling of diagnosis and treatment outcomes, [ 109 ] chatbots, conversational agents that imitate human behaviour and which have been studied for anxiety and depression. [ 110 ] Challenges include the fact that many applications in the field are developed and proposed by private corporations, such as the screening for suicidal ideation implemented by Facebook in 2017. [ 111 ] Such applications outside the healthcare system raise various professional, ethical and regulatory questions. [ 112 ] Another issue is often with the validity and interpretability of the models. Small training datasets contain bias that is inherited by the models, and compromises the generalizability and stability of these models. Such models may also have the potential to be discriminatory against minority groups that are underrepresented in samples. [ 113 ] In 2023, US-based National Eating Disorders Association replaced its human helpline staff with a chatbot but had to take it offline after users reported receiving harmful advice from it. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] Radiology [ edit ] AI is being studied within the field of radiology to detect and diagnose diseases through computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. [ 117 ] It may be particularly useful in settings where demand for human expertise exceeds supply, or where data is too complex to be efficiently interpreted by human readers. [ 118 ] Several deep learning models have shown the capability to be roughly as accurate as healthcare professionals in identifying diseases through medical imaging, though few of the studies reporting these findings have been externally validated. [ 119 ] AI can also provide non-interpretive benefit to radiologists, such as reducing noise in images, creating high-quality images from lower doses of radiation, enhancing MR image quality, [ 120 ] and automatically assessing image quality. [ 121 ] Further research investigating the use of AI in nuclear medicine focuses on image reconstruction, anatomical landmarking, and the enablement of lower doses in imaging studies. [ 122 ] The analysis of images for supervised AI applications in radiology encompasses two primary techniques at present: (1) convolutional neural network-based analysis; and (2) utilization of radiomics . [ 118 ] AI is also used in breast imaging for analyzing screening mammograms and can participate in improving breast cancer detection rate [ 123 ] as well as reducing radiologist's reading workload. Pharmacy [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Artificial intelligence in pharmacy . [ edit ] This article may require copy editing for grammar, style, cohesion, tone, or spelling . You can assist by editing it . ( May 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Part of a series on Artificial intelligence (AI) Major goals Artificial general intelligence Intelligent agent Recursive self-improvement Planning Computer vision General game playing Knowledge representation Natural language processing Robotics AI safety Approaches Machine learning Symbolic Deep learning Bayesian networks Evolutionary algorithms Hybrid intelligent systems Systems integration Applications Bioinformatics Deepfake Earth sciences Finance Generative AI Art Audio Music Government Healthcare Mental health Industry Translation Military Physics Projects Philosophy Artificial consciousness Chinese room Friendly AI Control problem / Takeover Ethics Existential risk Turing test Uncanny valley History Timeline Progress AI winter AI boom Glossary Glossary v t e Artificial Intelligence (AI) [ 124 ] [ 125 ] [ 126 ] is a field of computer science in which a huge amount of data is fed to a machine learning model, which allows the machine to learn patterns from that data and is able to make smart, calculated decisions, which can only be achieved by human intelligence . Artificial intelligence is playing a crucial role in driving the application and research in many fields and pharmacy is no exception. In pharmacy, the use of AI is leading to the discovery, development, and delivery of medications , and also enhancing patient care through personalized treatment plans. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] This article is going to summarize AI's application in drug research, drug safety, dose recommendation and examine the limitations and future directions of AI in pharmacy. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Industry [ edit ] The trend of large health companies merging allows for greater health data accessibility. Greater health data lays the groundwork for the implementation of AI algorithms. A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the clinical decision support systems . As more data is collected, machine learning algorithms adapt and allow for more robust responses and solutions. [ 117 ] Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of big data in the healthcare industry. Many companies investigate the market opportunities through the realms of \"data assessment, storage, management, and analysis technologies\" which are all crucial parts of the healthcare industry. [ 131 ] With the market for AI expanding constantly, large tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Baidu all have their own AI research divisions, as well as millions of dollars allocated for acquisition of smaller AI based companies. [ 131 ] The following are examples of large companies that are contributing to AI algorithms for use in healthcare: Amazon Web Services [ 132 ] Apple [ 132 ] Google 's DeepMind platform is being used by the UK National Health Service to detect certain health risks through data collected via a mobile app. A second project with the NHS involves the analysis of medical images collected from NHS patients to develop computer vision algorithms to detect cancerous tissues. IBM's Watson Oncology is in development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Cleveland Clinic . IBM is also working with CVS Health on AI applications in chronic disease treatment and with Johnson & Johnson on analysis of scientific papers to find new connections for drug development. In May 2017, IBM and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute began a joint project entitled Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning and Semantics (HEALS) , to explore using AI technology to enhance healthcare. Intel's venture capital arm Intel Capital invested in 2016 in the startup Lumiata, which uses AI to identify at-risk patients and develop care options. [ 133 ] Meta [ 132 ] Microsoft 's Hanover project, in partnership with Oregon Health & Science University 's Knight Cancer Institute, analyzes medical research to predict the most effective cancer drug treatment options for patients. Other projects include medical image analysis of tumor progression and the development of programmable cells. [ 134 ] Neuralink has come up with a next-generation neuroprosthetic which intricately interfaces with thousands of neural pathways in the brain. [ 117 ] Their process allows a chip, roughly the size of a quarter, to be inserted in the place of a chunk of a skull by a precision surgical robot to avoid accidental injury . [ 117 ] Elon Musk premiering the surgical robot that implants the Neuralink brain chip Ava Industries Ltd., a Canadian healthcare technology firm, is developing integrated AI tools to support clinical efficiency. Ava has implemented an embedded AI medical scribe within theis electronic medical record system (EMR) and is further developing tools such as an AI chart summarizer and an AI document classifier. [1] The company has received support through grants from Canada Health Infowayfor its work in advancing digital health solutions. [2] Tencent is working on several medical systems and services. These include AI Medical Innovation System (AIMIS) , an AI-powered diagnostic medical imaging service; WeChat Intelligent Healthcare; and Tencent Doctorwork Digital consultant apps use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user's medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution[ buzzword ] to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user (e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus) and value capturing mechanisms (e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders). IFlytek launched a service robot \"Xiao Man\", which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas. [ citation needed ] It also works in the field of medical imaging. Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH (\"Cruzr\") and Softbank Robotics (\"Pepper\"). [ citation needed ] The Indian startup Haptik developed a WhatsApp chatbot in 2021 which answers questions associated with the deadly coronavirus in India . Similarly, a software platform ChatBot in partnership with medtech startup Infermedica launched COVID-19 Risk Assessment ChatBot. [ 135 ] Many automobile manufacturers are beginning to use machine learning healthcare in their cars as well. [ 131 ] Companies such as BMW , GE , Tesla , Toyota , and Volvo all have new research campaigns to find ways of learning a driver's vital statistics to ensure they are awake, paying attention to the road, and not under the influence of substances. [ 131 ] Expanding care to developing nations [ edit ] Artificial intelligence continues to expand in its abilities to diagnose more people accurately in nations where fewer doctors are accessible to the public.\u00a0 Many new technology companies such as SpaceX and the Raspberry Pi Foundation have enabled more developing countries to have access to computers and the internet than ever before. [ 136 ] With the increasing capabilities of AI over the internet, advanced machine learning algorithms can allow patients to get accurately diagnosed when they would previously have no way of knowing if they had a life-threatening disease or not. [ 136 ] Using AI in developing nations that do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can improve patient care. AI can allow for not only diagnosis of patient in areas where healthcare is scarce, but also allow for a good patient experience by resourcing files to find the best treatment for a patient. [ 137 ] The ability of AI to adjust course as it goes also allows the patient to have their treatment modified based on what works for them; a level of individualized care that is nearly non-existent in developing countries. [ 137 ] Regulation [ edit ] This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( May 2025 ) Challenges of the clinical use of AI have brought about a potential need for regulations . AI studies need to be completely and transparently reported to have value to inform regulatory approval. Depending on the phase of study, international consensus-based reporting guidelines (TRIPOD+AI, [ 138 ] DECIDE-AI, [ 139 ] CONSORT-AI [ 140 ] ) have been developed to provide recommendations on the key details that need to be reported. A man speaking at the GDPR compliance workshop at the 2019 Entrepreneurship Summit While regulations exist pertaining to the collection of patient data such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the US ( HIPAA ) and the European General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) pertaining to patients within the EU, health care AI is \u201c\"severely under-regulated worldwide\" as of 2025. [ 132 ] Unclear is whether healthcare AI can be classified merely as software or as medical device . [ 132 ] United Nations (WHO/ITU) [ edit ] The joint ITU - WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H) has built a platform - known as the ITU-WHO AI for Health Framework - for the testing and benchmarking of AI applications in health domain. As of November 2018, eight use cases are being benchmarked, including assessing breast cancer risk from histopathological imagery, guiding anti-venom selection from snake images, and diagnosing skin lesions. USA [ edit ] United States Food & Drug Administration [ 141 ] In 2015, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued rules and regulations to protect the privacy of individuals\u2019 health information,  requiring healthcare providers to follow certain privacy rules when using AI, to keep a record of how they use AI and to ensure that their AI systems are secure. [ 142 ] In May 2016, the White House announced its plan to host a series of workshops and formation of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. [ citation needed ] In October 2016, the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, outlining its proposed priorities for Federally-funded AI research and development (within government and academia). The report notes a strategic R&D plan for the subfield of health information technology was in development stages. [ citation needed ] In January 2021, the US FDA published a new Action Plan, entitled Artificial Intelligence (AI) /Machine Learning (ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) Action Plan. [ 143 ] It layed out the FDA's future plans for regulation of medical devices that would include artificial intelligence in their software with five main actions: 1. Tailored Regulatory Framework for Ai/M:-based SaMD, 2. Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP), 3. Patient-Centered Approach Incorporating Transparency to Users, 4. Regulatory Science Methods Related to Algorithm Bias & Robustness, and 5. Real-World Performance(RWP). This plan was in direct response to stakeholders' feedback on a 2019 discussion paper also published by the FDA. [ 143 ] Under President Biden the DHSS and the National Institute of Standards and Technology were instructed to develop regulation of healthcare AI. [ 132 ] According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , the OCR issued guidance on the ethical use of AI in healthcare in 2021. It outlined four core ethical principles that must be followed: respect for autonomy , beneficence (ethics) , non-maleficence , and justice. Respect for autonomy requires that individuals have control over their own data and decisions. Beneficence requires that AI be used to do good, such as improving the quality of care and reducing health disparities. Non-maleficence requires that AI be used to do no harm, such as avoiding discrimination in decisions. Finally, justice requires that AI be used fairly, such as using the same standards for decisions no matter a person's race, gender, or income level. As of March 2021, the OCR had hired a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (OCAIO) to pursue the \"implementation of the HHS AI strategy\". [ 144 ] With the second Trump administration deregulation of health AI began on January 20, 2025 with merely voluntary standards for collecting and sharing data, statutory definitions for algorithmic discrimination, automation bias, and equity being cancelled, cuts to NIST and 19% of FDA workforce eliminated. [ 132 ] Europe [ edit ] Other countries have implemented data protection regulations, more specifically with company privacy invasions. In Denmark, the Danish Expert Group on data ethics has adopted recommendations on 'Data for the Benefit of the People'. These recommendations are intended to encourage the responsible use of data in the business sector, with a focus on data processing. The recommendations include a focus on equality and non-discrimination with regard to bias in AI, as well as human dignity which is to outweigh profit and must be respected in all data processes. [ 145 ] The European Union has implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect citizens' personal data, which applies to the use of AI in healthcare. In addition, the European Commission has established guidelines to ensure the ethical development of AI, including the use of algorithms to ensure fairness and transparency. [ 146 ] With GDPR, the European Union was the first to regulate AI through data protection legislation. The Union finds privacy as a fundamental human right, it wants to prevent unconsented and secondary uses of data by private or public health facilities. By streamlining access to personal data for health research and findings, they are able to instate the right and importance of patient privacy. [ 146 ] In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires organizations to protect the privacy and security of patient information. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have also released guidelines for the development of AI-based medical applications. [ 147 ] In 2025, Europe was leading the USA on AI regulation, while lagging in innovation and at least one California-based biotech company was \"engaging the European Medicines Agency earlier in development than previously anticipated to mitigate concerns about the FDA's ability to meet development timelines.\" [ 132 ] Ethical concerns [ edit ] While research on the use of AI in healthcare aims to validate its efficacy in improving patient outcomes before its broader adoption, its use may introduce several new types of risk to patients and healthcare providers, such as algorithmic bias , Do not resuscitate implications, and other machine morality issues. AI may also compromise the protection of patients' rights, such as the right to informed consent and the right to medical data protection. [ 148 ] Data collection, privacy - autonomy [ edit ] In order to effectively train Machine Learning and use AI in healthcare, massive amounts of data must be gathered. Acquiring this data, however, comes at the cost of patient privacy , i.e. autonomy in most cases and is not well received publicly. For example, a survey conducted in the UK estimated that 63% of the population is uncomfortable with sharing their personal data in order to improve artificial intelligence technology. [ 149 ] The scarcity of real, accessible patient data is a hindrance that deters the progress of developing and deploying more artificial intelligence in healthcare. The lack of regulations surrounding AI in the United States has generated concerns about mismanagement of patient data, such as with corporations utilizing patient data for financial gain. For example, as of 2020 Roche , a Swiss healthcare company, was found to have purchased healthcare data for approximately 2 million cancer patients at an estimated total cost of $1.9 billion. [ 150 ] Naturally, this generates questions of ethical concern; Is there a monetary price that can be set for data, and should it depend on its perceived value or contributions to science? Is it fair to patients to sell their data? These concerns were addressed in a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2022 that asked Americans for their opinions about the increased presence of AI in their daily lives, and the survey estimated that 37% of Americans were more concerned than excited about such increased presence, with 8% of participants specifically associating their concern with \"people misusing AI\". [ 151 ] Ultimately, the current potential of artificial intelligence in healthcare is additionally hindered by  concerns about mismanagement of data collected, especially in the United States. Automation- beneficence [ edit ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic , or fulfill beneficence . [ 16 ] According to a 2019 study, AI can replace up to 35% of jobs in the UK within the next 10 to 20 years. [ 152 ] However, of these jobs, it was concluded that AI has not eliminated any healthcare jobs so far. Though if AI were to automate healthcare-related jobs, the jobs most susceptible to automation would be those dealing with digital information, radiology, and pathology, as opposed to those dealing with doctor-to-patient interaction. [ 152 ] Ouutputs can be incorrect or incomplete and diagnosis and recommendations harm people. [ 132 ] Bias, discrimination [ edit ] Since AI makes decisions solely on the data it receives as input, it is important that this data represents accurate patient demographics. In a hospital setting, patients do not have full knowledge of how predictive algorithms are created or calibrated. Therefore, these medical establishments can unfairly code their algorithms to discriminate against minorities and prioritize profits rather than providing optimal care, i.e. violating the ethical principle of social justice or non-maleficence . [ 153 ] A recent scoping review identified 18 equity challenges along with 15 strategies that can be implemented to help address them when AI applications are developed using many-to-many mapping. [ 154 ] There can be unintended bias in algorithms that can exacerbate social and healthcare inequities. [ 153 ] Since AI's decisions are a direct reflection of its input data, the data it receives must have accurate representation of patient demographics. For instance, if populations are less represented in healthcare data it is likely to create bias in AI tools that lead to incorrect assumptions of a demographic and impact the ability to provide appropriate care. [ 155 ] White males are overly represented in medical data sets. [ 156 ] Therefore, having minimal patient data on minorities can lead to AI making more accurate predictions for majority populations, leading to unintended worse medical outcomes for minority populations. [ 157 ] Collecting data from minority communities can also lead to medical discrimination. For instance, HIV is a prevalent virus among minority communities and HIV status can be used to discriminate against patients. [ 156 ] In addition to biases that may arise from sample selection, different clinical systems used to collect data may also impact AI functionality. For example, radiographic systems and their outcomes (e.g., resolution) vary by provider. Moreover, clinician work practices, such as the positioning of the patient for radiography, can also greatly influence the data and make comparability difficult. [ 158 ] However, these biases are able to be eliminated through careful implementation and a methodical collection of representative data. A final source of algorithmic bias , which has been called \"label choice bias\", arises when proxy measures are used to train algorithms, that build in bias against certain groups. For example, a widely used algorithm predicted health care costs as a proxy for health care needs, and used predictions to allocate resources to help patients with complex health needs. This introduced bias because Black patients have lower costs, even when they are just as unhealthy as White patients. [ 159 ] Solutions to the \"label choice bias\" aim to match the actual target (what the algorithm is predicting) more closely to the ideal target (what researchers want the algorithm to predict), so for the prior example, instead of predicting cost, researchers would focus on the variable of healthcare needs which is rather more significant. Adjusting the target led to almost double the number of Black patients being selected for the program. History [ edit ] Research in the 1960s and 1970s produced the first problem-solving program, or expert system , known as Dendral . [ 160 ] [ 161 ] While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry, it provided the basis for a subsequent system MYCIN , [ 162 ] considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine. [ 162 ] [ 163 ] MYCIN and other systems such as INTERNIST-1 and CASNET did not achieve routine use by practitioners, however. [ 164 ] The 1980s and 1990s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity. During this time, there was a recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physicians. [ 165 ] Approaches involving fuzzy set theory, [ 166 ] Bayesian networks , [ 167 ] and artificial neural networks , [ 168 ] [ 169 ] have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare. Medical and technological advancements occurring over this half-century period that have enabled the growth of healthcare-related applications of AI to include: Improvements in computing power resulting in faster data collection and data processing [ 170 ] Growth of genomic sequencing databases [ 171 ] Widespread implementation of electronic health record systems [ 172 ] Improvements in natural language processing and computer vision , enabling machines to replicate human perceptual processes [ 173 ] [ 174 ] Enhanced the precision of robot-assisted surgery [ 175 ] Increased tree-based machine learning models that allow flexibility in establishing health predictors [ 176 ] Improvements in deep learning techniques and data logs for rare diseases See also [ edit ] AI alignment Artificial intelligence in mental health Artificial intelligence Glossary of artificial intelligence Full body scanner (i.e. Dermascanner , ...)

While there are only a handful of practical examples for its medical use with enough evidence, hype around the topic is unprecedented 1 . There is a growing list of publications on the subject in the form of academic articles, health policy reports, statements from professional societies, and popular media coverage (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1: Number of medical A.I. studies by year from 2010 to 2020; and by medical specialties. a The number of studies as found on Pubmed.com using the search term)\u201cmachine learning\u201d OR \u201cdeep learning\u201d) and choosing a year in advanced search. b The same search method was used followed by (AND specialty) without specifying a time frame. The number in the circles determine how many studies we found. Full size image A.I. has been used extensively in industries such as transportation, entertainment or IT during the last decade. It has been used to control self-driving vehicles; to trade on the stock market; social media platforms, web browsers and search engines. It is likely that the reader of this paper used some forms of A.I. today for more than an hour by using services such as Google Maps, Waze, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn or Google Search, among a myriad of others. It has potentials in medicine, drug design and healthcare, yet, the proof and evidence are yet to be convincing enough for the general public and the medical community to adopt the technology 2 . The technology is still in its infancy and more studies are published each year than the year before. There are so many papers, conference talks, misleading news headlines and study interpretations that a short and visual guide any medical professional can refer back to in their professional life might be useful. There is no doubt that A.I. will have a beneficial role in healthcare and can penetrate the boundaries of adoption only if medical professionals serve as knowledgeable and supportive guides and leaders in the process 3 . For this, it is critical that physicians understand the basics of the technology so they can see beyond the hype, evaluate A.I.-based studies and clinical validation; as well as acknowledge the limitations and opportunities A.I. has. This paper aims to serve as a short, visual and digestible repository of information and details every physician might need to know in the age of A.I. We describe the simple definition of A.I., its levels, its methods, the differences between the methods with medical examples, the potential benefits, dangers, challenges of A.I., as well as we attempt at providing a futuristic vision about using it in an everyday medical practice. Definition and levels of A.I. A.I. is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer science, psychology, linguistics, and philosophy, among others. According to its simplest definition, artificial intelligence (A.I.) is intelligence demonstrated by machines. It is sometimes also described as \u201cmachines that mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as learning and problem solving\u201d 4 . Nick Bostrom, philosopher at the University of Oxford, described three major levels in the development of A.I. in his book Superintelligence (Fig. 2 5 ). Fig. 2: Levels of A.I. The three levels of A.I. as defined by Nick Bostrom in Superintelligence. The green dot indicates a theoretical threshold for what the ideal scenario would be. Full size image Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) ANI already has incredible pattern recognizing abilities in huge data sets, which makes it perfect for solving text, voice, or image-based classification and clustering problems. It is an algorithm that can excel at a precisely defined, single task. It can play chess like nobody else ever, yet its IQ is zero. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) one day could have a human being\u2019s comprehensive and total cognitive capacity. This is human level A.I. It can reason, argue, memorize and solve issues like you do Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI) theoretically could have humanity\u2019s combined cognitive capacity or even more. Humanity, obviously, would not be able to grasp its knowledge and understand its reasoning. Many organizations work hard to avoid ever reaching this stage. How does A.I. work? A.I. works through a method called machine learning. As there are challenges and tasks so complicated in healthcare that writing traditional algorithms for solving those was not enough anymore, a new method was needed. Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed 6 . If you feed the algorithm with enough data of good quality, machine learning allows them to create strategies for excelling at that particular task. If I want to write a program that can spot cats on photos, I had better turn to machine learning. The reasons why quickly become clear if you try to devise rules that such a program should be based on. How can you spot a cat in a photo? If you devise features you think easily depict cats such as having two ears, two eyes, four legs and such, you find yourself in a situation where you also have to define all these expressions. What is an ear for a program that only \u201csees\u201d pixels on a photo? Therefore, the most efficient way is to feed a machine learning algorithm with images with cats on them, preferably with cats that have been annotated manually by human beings to make sure the images do contain cats. The more such annotated images we feed the algorithm with, the better it will become at recognizing cats on images. It will not understand what a cat is, but it will certainly recognize what we think are cats in photos like we do with an increasing and ruthless efficiency. No matter what task we aim to solve, we feed the simpler machine learning algorithms with data and constantly iterate how it digests it to become better at solving the task. With more complex algorithms such as neural networks and deep learning, it is possible that the algorithm starts creating its own rules and strategies without human input. From there, not even its developers might understand how it draws a conclusion or the strategy it uses to excel at a task. When it comes to technologies we use to make medical decisions, we like to understand the core of the machine or at least the physical/biological explanations behind it. In the case of advanced A.I.-based algorithms, it seems we will not be able to understand more than the theoretical basics. Real-life examples for the subtypes of machine learning Machine learning has many subtypes and combined methods, but we only feature the three major subtypes besides an advanced method, deep learning (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3: Visual guide to machine and deep learning subtypes. a In supervised learning, the teacher (developer) knows what he wants to teach to the child (A.I.), defines the expected answer and the child learns to excel at the task. b In unsupervised learning, the teacher does not influence how the child learns to play but observes the conclusions the child can draw from solving the task. c In reinforcement learning, the teacher knows what he wants to teach to the child but does not define step-by-step how the child should learn it. Instead, the teacher only gives feedback after the task is completed and asks the child to find out his own strategy using those outcomes the teacher rewarded. d In deep learning, it is possible to analyze vastly more complex data sets from images and videos to a sort of human reasoning. It is multi-layered and could mimic how neural networks in the brain work. Full size image Supervised learning Is used when we can precisely define the task we want the algorithm to learn based on data that we already have. Let\u2019s take the following example. We have two sets of medical records of patients, group A and B. In one set, we have family history, lab markers and other details with the diagnosis. In the other set, we have the same kinds of data but without the diagnosis. We would like to build a model that can learn to assign the right diagnosis to patients in group B based on the associations and labels the algorithm learns about in group A. It is like learning with a teacher because we know exactly what the algorithm should learn, and it is by far the most frequently used training mode. Unsupervised learning Is like learning without a teacher. We have a group of patients with different sets of data, but we do not know their individual diagnoses. We build a model, then to try to cluster patients based on similar attributes such as the symptoms they presented with, their lab markers or age and gender. We might learn new associations we have not looked at before. In another example, it can also be useful in clustering tissue samples based on similar gene expression values; or in finding novel drug-drug interactions. In summary, we devise certain rules, let the algorithm learn by itself and we do not modify the algorithm based on the outcome. Reinforcement learning Allows the algorithm to learn how to complete the tasks with a sequence of decisions by itself without being told how to do it. The teacher is only able to give feedback after a series of actions, not for each item as it does with supervised learning. The model starts performing the task only knowing some basic rules, and after failing or succeeding in completing the task, the teacher weighs in to push it to use the winning strategy more. This way, the program can build its own experiences as it performs the task more and more. It is similar to how we train dogs. When the dog performs or tries to perform a task, we only give it a treat if it performed well. The most famous example for this method is how AlphaZero can learn to become the best player in any 2-players game in hours by playing millions of games against itself. It starts playing a game knowing only its basic rules, and the developers let the algorithm know when it won a match to prioritize that strategy while playing the next game 7 . In an example, authors used this method to determine clinical trial dosing, where the algorithm learnt the appropriate dosing regimen to reduce mean tumor diameters in patients undergoing chemo- and radiation therapy 8 . The main challenge with applying reinforcement learning to healthcare is that we cannot play out a large number of scenarios as the lives of patients are at stake. Machine learning vs traditional statistical models A.I. is a huge domain which includes machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, but also methods that do not even process quantitative data. Therefore, it makes sense to compare machine learning to traditional statistical methods. Traditional statistical models focus on discovering relationships and confidence intervals between data points and outcomes. Compared to this, machine learning methods aim to reach high prediction accuracy with putting less emphasis on whether it is possible to interpret the model. The former often analyses a given dataset for its insights, while the latter is trained on a set of data, evaluated on a second set, and then used on an unseen third. Thus, prediction is key in machine learning to generate otherwise unavailable (e.g., expensive or not yet known) data. Also, machine learning is often better suited for large numbers of input variables (think of images with thousands of pixels), while traditional analysis with statistical models was designed for data with tens of input columns 9 . Machine vs deep learning Machine learning is a broad set of methods, their majority were used even decades before the current A.I. revolution. Most breakthroughs are achieved nowadays with artificial neural networks, but there are several other models, each with its own advantages. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and while it has similar functions, its capabilities are different. Deep learning uses a layered structure of artificial neural networks that is inspired by the neural network of the human brain. The internal structure and number of layers within a neural network is a field of active research, but as a rule of thumb we can say that a deeper net with more layers can learn more complex tasks - at the same time requiring more data and longer time to train. Deep models have the capacity to process images, sound and other high dimensionality data with good results, while other machine learning models may perform better with data organized into a spreadsheet. Looking at a medical example, let\u2019s build a model that can cluster patients by diagnosis based on the data in their medical records. If a medical record contains the expression Type 1 Diabetes, a machine learning model will learn to put all such patients in the Type 1 Diabetes cluster. But a deep learning algorithm could learn with time without human input that patients with medical records that only mention T1D should also be assigned to the same group. Programmers of other machine learning algorithms should add these alternatives themselves. Another example might also demonstrate the power and potentials of deep learning. We would like to build a model that turns on the light if we shout the word dark. A deep learning model, by time, would learn that saying \u201cI can\u2019t see\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s dark here\u201d should also turn on the light. How to evaluate news and studies about A.I.? Hardly a day goes by without promising research papers and studies on how to apply machine and deep learning to medical problems. However, as already just mentioning A.I. makes companies\u2019 prospects better on any market, overhyping and overmarketing what an algorithm can do is an everyday phenomenon. There are still ways that help evaluate research papers and news on A.I. There are some general questions we can ask ourselves while reading medical A.I. papers. (Table 1 ) 10 , 11 . Table 1 A summary of some general questions readers of an A.I. medical paper might want to ask themselves to evaluate the quality of the results of a research. Full size table Besides obvious features such as the quality of the journal the paper was published in (real breakthroughs tend to be able to reach the attention of high-level journals), the most important factor is the source of data. It matters where the data stems from, thus it is worth checking the \u2018Methods\u2019 section where authors describe how, where and what kind of data they received. No algorithm can be trained without a good amount of quality data. Moreover, the size of the dataset also matters: the more images, text or any other source materials the researchers have, the more precise the algorithms can become. Collaborations with clinicians and healthcare institutions are crucial in getting large amounts of quality data. If not, some research groups do tricks on their dataset to make it bigger (e.g., rotate images to double the database size). The reported performance (e.g., precision, speed) of the algorithm should be compared to previously existing solutions and human abilities. Even a state-of-the-art technical solution may perform so much worse than human professionals in a real-world clinical setting, that it may not be helpful at all. It is crucial for such technologies to be evaluated whether they can easily be implemented in clinical protocols, and whether the results are straightforward for the medical staff to interpret. It is also key to see whether the paper analyzed a real clinical problem. An algorithm might perform very well on a pre-selected dataset, however, it should also be tested on real clinical data. DeepMind claimed in its published study that its model was able to accurately predict that a patient will develop acute kidney failure \u201cwithin a clinically actionable window\u201d up to 48\u2009h in advance 12 . While the algorithm did do that, it cannot be clinically validated without testing it prospectively in a clinical setting. Also, when you look at the latest pieces of news on smart algorithms, you should watch out for the following to be able to carefully assess the quality of the given A.I.-related article. The term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d itself might be misleading as due to the overuse of the expression, its meaning started to get inflated. If an announcement or news article mentions A.I. without describing the exact method under it, it is a good sign to be skeptical and careful. A company or a research group should mention a subtype of machine or deep learning and be able to explain the method in detail with which they are aiming to create A.I. In a relevant example that took place in Thailand, a Google-backed algorithm aimed at improving care. There, normally, nurses took photos of the eyes of patients during check-ups and shared those to be analyzed by a specialist elsewhere. This process could take up to 10 weeks. The A.I. developed by Google Health identified signs of diabetic retinopathy from an eye scan with an accuracy of more than 90% and provide a result in less than 10\u2009min. When Google started putting this system into practice, they ran into real-life issues. Sometimes a bad internet connection stopped the whole system from working as all images had to be uploaded to the cloud through a strong connection. If the quality of the scan did not meet a certain threshold, it simply did not give a result (the deep learning algorithm has to be fed with high quality images to get better). This way, nurses had to spend time editing some of the images the algorithm chose not to analyze. Developers had to travel to the site to help sort out these issues 13 . As a summary, the medical journal Radiology proposed a guide for authors, reviewers, and readers for assessing radiology research on artificial intelligence 10 . Other medical associations and journal editorial boards might adopt and customize it too. They also describe a checklist that every author should complete when publishing their A.I. research. Examples for how healthcare could benefit from A.I. In short, tasks that are highly repetitive and involve the analysis of quantifiable data might benefit the most from the use of A.I. We feature a few examples that provide a picture about the whole range of opportunities. Improving in-person and online consultations Babylon Health launched an application that offers A.I.-driven consultation. It uses the patient\u2019s medical history and common medical knowledge. Patients report their symptoms through the app which checks those in a database of diseases using speech recognition. After that, it offers a course of action 14 . Health assistance and medication management The medical start-up Sense.ly developed Molly, a virtual nurse that was designed to have a smiling face coupled with a pleasant voice. Its goal is to help assist patients with monitoring their health or disease management in-between doctor\u2019s visits using ML. It also provides customized follow-up care, with a focus on chronic diseases 15 . A similar approach was used by the AiCure app that uses a smartphone\u2019s camera and A.I. to confirm that patients are adhering to their prescriptions 16 . This could be useful for people with serious medical conditions or participants in clinical trials. A.I.-driven diagnostics In 2020, the FDA approved a software programme from the company Caption Health that allows medical professionals to perform cardiac ultrasound imaging without specialized training. It uses A.I. to provide real-time guidance and also the ability to save images of diagnostic quality. It acts as a \u201cco-pilot\u201d for those performing an ultrasound scan as it was designed to emulate the guidance that an expert sonographer would provide to optimize the image. It gives instructions on how to manipulate the transducer, and provides automated feedback on diagnostic image quality 17 . Mining medical records Collecting, storing, normalizing, and tracking medical records is an obvious step for A.I. As an example, Google Deepmind Health is cooperating with the Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust to improve eye treatment by analyzing retina scans. The images are analyzed by DeepMind\u2019s algorithms resulting in a detailed diagnosis and a so-called \u201curgency score\u201d in about 30\u2009s. The prototype system can detect diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration 18 . Precision medicine The company Deep Genomics aims at identifying patterns in genetic data and medical records of patients trying to link mutations to medical conditions. Oncompass Medicine uses A.I.-based algorithms to match genetic mutations found in patients\u2019 tumor samples with ongoing clinical trials worldwide. This way, patients can receive precisely targeted treatments specific to the kind of cancerous tissue they have. Designing treatment plans IBM Watson developed a software that provides evidence-based treatment options for oncologists. It was designed to analyze both structured and unstructured data in medical records that may contribute to decision-making about treatment pathways. The software combines data from the patient\u2019s medical record with clinical expertise, and research papers to suggest promising treatment plans 19 . There are many similar examples in other specialties. Creating an optimized radiation therapy delivery plan usually takes days. A.I.-based technologies help speed this process, completing the process in a couple of minutes 20 , 21 . Drug creation The way pharmaceutical companies develop new drugs through clinical trials can take several years and can cost billions of dollars. Speeding this up while making it more cost-effective would have an enormous effect on healthcare. The company Atomwise uses supercomputers to root out treatments from a database of molecular structures. They also launched a search for a previously unknown combination of safe and existing medicines and in a few days found two drugs predicted by the company\u2019s A.I. technology which may significantly reduce the infectivity of Ebola. Such analysis typically would have taken months or years 22 . Triage tools It is crucial to be able to predict how severe a patient\u2019s medical condition is to support the early identification of those who are vulnerable and at high-risk, especially in emergency medical services. In a study, authors developed and validated an A.I.-based algorithm using deep learning that accurately predicted the need for the critical care of patients and outperformed the conventional triage tools and early warning scores 23 . In another study, authors analyzed online triage tools from more than 150 000 patient interactions with a chatbot, and they found a decreased level of the urgency of patients\u2019 intended level of care in more than one-quarter of the cases 24 . Both studies indicate that A.I.-based technologies can facilitate triaging even before patients reach the point-of-care. How can an A.I.-based medical technology become part of an everyday practice? The success of A.I. and its place in medicine and healthcare highly depend on whether it can penetrate the boundaries of evidence-based medicine, the lack of policies and reluctance from medical professionals to use it. There is no reason to believe that its use will be able to become common practice without meeting the standards and requirements of previous technologies. However, as the demand for A.I. to be implemented into everyday medicine is getting higher by patients, policy makers, medical professionals and hospitals, its way from developers to practice will have to become faster 25 . A typical example of how it has worked so far is related to Kardia, formerly known as AliveCor. They first made an FDA-approved smartphone case that worked as a single lead ECG in 2012. They launched two clinical trials to test the hardware and the app comparing it to a traditional 12-lead device. Later, the evolution of its design resulted in a credit-card sized device and an even smaller version in 2019. The original device could provide a one channel ECG by playing the user\u2019s fingertips on the sensor for 30\u2009s. The results were uploaded to the cloud to make it accessible for physicians. In 2015, Alivecor received clearance by the FDA to use an algorithm for the analysis of the readings to determine issues related to heart rhythm without human help. By the end of 2017, they already used deep learning networks, and the FDA cleared the company\u2019s ECG reader called KardiaBand as a medical device accessory to the Apple Watch. A study concluded that the device managed to distinguish between atrial fibrillation and a normal heart rhythm with a sensitivity of 93, and a specificity of 94%, respectively. Its sensitivity increased to 99% when a medical professional reviewed the reading 26 . By 2020, products of Alivecor have been tested in over 40 clinical studies. Despite these accomplishments, the use of the device is still not common practice. And as other companies producing A.I.-based medical technologies are lagging behind, it might depict a long period of adoption. A.I. will only reach the status of an everyday medical technology if medical associations provide clear guidelines about implementing it; if policy makers create policies that favor adoption; and if the medical community does not look at A.I. as a threat, but rather, as the stethoscope of the 21st century. What are the major challenges ahead? Examples for ANI do exist today, but there are major issues the A.I. developer and the medical community have to face and tackle before A.I. can become mainstream in medicine. Explainability Medical professionals tend to make decisions using data that were obtained with technologies they either understand or understand the basics enough to trust it. In the case of A.I., it might not be possible. However, millions of learned parameters (the connection weights within the network) determine the output of a deep neural network, which makes it unintuitive to understand the decision process. Even if we visualize the sensitivity of different parts of a network and browse these thousands of noisy images, we will still not see easy-to-grasp learned rules. Reasoning is not a by-product of the algorithm. Thus, explainable A.I. would be crucial in providing insights into A.I.-based algorithms enough to gain trust in them. Augmented intelligence This is a term often promoted by organizations such as the American Medical Association. It focuses on A.I.\u2019s assistive role in healthcare emphasizing that A.I.\u2018s design enhances human intelligence rather than replaces it. It also refers to the value an A.I. can provide that comes from how we can combine the unique capabilities of human experts with those of A.I. to provide better care for patients. A similar term that is related to augmented intelligence is \u201chuman-centered A.I.\u201d which explores the need for the development of A.I.-based systems that learn from and collaborate with humans in a deep and meaningful way. Quality and quantity of data A.I. feeds on data. The more and better quality data it gets access to, the more it can excel at tasks. Advanced algorithms need annotated data to make sure those can learn the task they were designed for. There are medical professionals who act as data annotators which is a time-consuming and monotonous task. Some medical algorithms can only improve through large amounts of annotated data. Therefore the dedicated contribution of data annotators is of crucial importance for the benefit of implementing A.I. in the healthcare setting. Therefore, we can conclude that data annotators are the unsung heroes of the medical A.I. revolution 27 . Privacy issues Medical A.I. needs access to medical records, data from health sensors, medical algorithms, apps and whatever source of information it can learn from. The data can come from healthcare institutions or from individuals. Even if institutions make data anonymized, it was proven in many cases that individual profiles can be traced back. Legal issues and liability What if a deep learning algorithm misses a diagnosis, the doctor accepts the judgment and the patient suffers from the consequences? What if an autonomous surgical robot injures a patient during a procedure? It is an ongoing debate about who will be held liable in the future when robots and A.I., acting autonomously, harm patients. Current consensus states that the professional is open to liability if he or she used the tool in a situation outside the scope of its regulatory approval, or misused it, or applied it despite significant professional doubts of the validity of the evidence surrounding the tool, or with knowledge of the toolmaker obfuscating negative facts. In any other cases, liability falls back on the creators and the companies behind them. Trust We will need a lot of time to trust an autonomous car, to see how it reacts in situations we are familiar with or whether it makes similar decisions in an emergency. Consequently, it will take even more time not only for patients but for medical professionals too to trust A.I. with medical diagnoses, supporting medical decision-making or designing new drugs. This should be taken into consideration when we decide to adopt the technology into the healthcare setting. Biased A.I. A study concluded that commercial companies\u2019 facial-recognition systems were more accurate on lighter-skinned individuals by 11\u201319%. Those produced especially inaccurate results when identifying women of color. In another example, A.I. was implemented in the United States\u2019 criminal justice system in order to predict recidivism. They found that the algorithm predicted disproportionately high probability of black people committing future crimes, no matter how minor their initial offense was. It is not only racial prejudice, but A.I. algorithms also often discriminate against women, minorities, other cultures, or ideologies. For example, Amazon\u2019s HR department had to stop using their A.I.-based machine learning tool which the company developed for sorting out the best job applicants, as it turned out that the smart algorithm favored men. As such algorithms learn from the data they are fed with, A.I. programmers must know about the issue of bias in algorithms and actively fight against it by tailoring them 28 . Patient design When designing algorithms for medical purposes, patients should be involved on the highest level of decision making to make sure their needs are met, and issues and recommendations are built into the technology. An example about its importance is how a start-up developed an algorithm that could detect signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in phone calls of patients in Canada. However, it showed different results with patients who had a French accent. By inviting patients at the early stages of development, such issues could be avoided. As there are positive ongoing efforts for solving each of these, it is still an open question whether those algorithms that become a common part of medical practices would be able to address them all 29 . The future role of A.I. in medicine and healthcar e Every A.I.-based technology that is considered for use in healthcare must be regulated, efficient and backed by evidence 30 . The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been showing an example in achieving a regulatory environment that not only welcomes such innovations but is also able to keep them safe for the public. The FDA launched a branch for digital health in 2019 and has attempted at designing new regulatory standards for A.I.-based technologies. The FDA realized that in the era of A.I., more algorithms will become available than medical devices as there is a shift from hardware to software. As the number of algorithms to be regulated grows exponentially, the current resources of regulatory bodies will not be sufficient for assessing each iteration and update. There have been discussions around a new regulatory framework for modifications to A.I./machine learning-based software as a medical device (SaMD) 31 . This could potentially lead to regulations that make it possible for regulators to assess companies while the companies can roll out algorithms and updates without the need to check them all. This is a viable way of letting A.I.-based technologies become widespread while keeping them safe. Our research group has attempted at creating a constantly updated database of FDA-approved A.I.-based medical technologies. After cross-checking and validating every approval we could find, we identified 64 A.I.-based and, at the same time, FDA approved medical technologies. Only 29 of those (45%) mentioned any A.I.-related terms or expressions in the announcement released by the FDA. Such technologies can only be efficient if they are successfully implemented into the medical practice. The American Medical Association (AMA) has addressed the importance of A.I., has advocated for the use of the expression augmented intelligence, and has assumed thought leadership with its reports and guidelines for physicians. In their AI policy, they state that \u201cas a leader in American medicine, our AMA has a unique opportunity to ensure that the evolution of AI in medicine benefits patients, physicians and the health care community\u201d 32 . To make sure that A.I.-based technologies meet the standards of evidence-based medicine, numerous editorial boards of medical journals and prestigious medical associations such as the WHO or CDC have released their recommendations for the medical community 33 , 34 . One of the potential obstacles in adoption can be a common fear among medical professionals that A.I. will replace them. While highly repetitive and data-based professions, or rather tasks under those professions will probably be highly impacted by automation, the core of the medical profession is and still will be the human touch, empathy and compassionate care; attributes that are almost impossible to mimic through a programming language. However, as a general rule of thumb, we might be able to assume that those medical professionals who use A.I. will replace those who do not do so. That is how such a profound role A.I. will have in the future of medicine. The debate early in the 21st century should not be about whether A.I. takes away the human touch or the art of medicine, but what we should do to improve both with it. When an algorithm using reinforcement learning, thus not being restricted by our human cognitive limitations, comes up with a cure which we could never find with our knowledge about biology, medicine and other life science, the real art of medicine will be to find out and to understand how it did that 35 . With this basic knowledge about the definition, levels, methods, challenges and potentials of A.I., we tried to give an overview about how we can make the medical profession more creative, spending more time with patients than ever.

In this review article, we outline recent breakthroughs in the application of AI in healthcare, describe a roadmap to building effective, reliable and safe AI systems, and discuss the possible future direction of AI augmented healthcare systems. KEYWORDS: AI, digital health Introduction Healthcare systems around the world face significant challenges in achieving the \u2018quadruple aim\u2019 for healthcare: improve population health, improve the patient's experience of care, enhance caregiver experience and reduce the rising cost of care. 1\u20133 Ageing populations, growing burden of chronic diseases and rising costs of healthcare globally are challenging governments, payers, regulators and providers to innovate and transform models of healthcare delivery. Moreover, against a backdrop now catalysed by the global pandemic, healthcare systems find themselves challenged to \u2018perform\u2019 (deliver effective, high-quality care) and \u2018transform\u2019 care at scale by leveraging real-world data driven insights directly into patient care. The pandemic has also highlighted the shortages in healthcare workforce and inequities in the access to care, previously articulated by The King's Fund and the World Health Organization (Box 1 ). 4,5 Box 1. Workforce challenges in the next decade By 2030, the gap between supply of and demand for staff employed by NHS trusts could increase to almost 250,000 full-time equivalent posts. 4 Based on the current trends and needs of the global population by 2030, the world will have 18 million fewer healthcare professionals (especially marked differences in the developing world), including 5 million fewer doctors than society will require. 5 Open in a new tab The application of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has the potential to address some of these supply-and-demand challenges. The increasing availability of multi-modal data (genomics, economic, demographic, clinical and phenotypic) coupled with technology innovations in mobile, internet of things (IoT), computing power and data security herald a moment of convergence between healthcare and technology to fundamentally transform models of healthcare delivery through AI-augmented healthcare systems. In particular, cloud computing is enabling the transition of effective and safe AI systems into mainstream healthcare delivery. Cloud computing is providing the computing capacity for the analysis of considerably large amounts of data, at higher speeds and lower costs compared with historic \u2018on premises\u2019 infrastructure of healthcare organisations. Indeed, we observe that many technology providers are increasingly seeking to partner with healthcare organisations to drive AI-driven medical innovation enabled by cloud computing and technology-related transformation (Box 2 ). 6\u20138 Box 2. Quotes from technology leaders Satya Nadella, chief executive officer, Microsoft: \u2018AI is perhaps the most transformational technology of our time, and healthcare is perhaps AI's most pressing application.\u2019 6 Tim Cook, chief executive officer, Apple: \u2018[Healthcare] is a business opportunity ... if you look at it, medical health activity is the largest or second-largest component of the economy.\u2019 7 Google Health: \u2018We think that AI is poised to transform medicine, delivering new, assistive technologies that will empower doctors to better serve their patients. Machine learning has dozens of possible application areas, but healthcare stands out as a remarkable opportunity to benefit people.\u2019 8 Open in a new tab Here, we summarise recent breakthroughs in the application of AI in healthcare, describe a roadmap to building effective AI systems and discuss the possible future direction of AI augmented healthcare systems. What is artificial intelligence? Simply put, AI refers to the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, through algorithms or a set of rules, which the machine follows to mimic human cognitive functions, such as learning and problem solving. 9 AI systems have the potential to anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up and, as such, operate in an intentional, intelligent and adaptive manner. 10 AI's strength is in its ability to learn and recognise patterns and relationships from large multidimensional and multimodal datasets; for example, AI systems could translate a patient's entire medical record into a single number that represents a likely diagnosis. 11,12 Moreover, AI systems are dynamic and autonomous, learning and adapting as more data become available. 13 AI is not one ubiquitous, universal technology, rather, it represents several subfields (such as machine learning and deep learning) that, individually or in combination, add intelligence to applications. Machine learning (ML) refers to the study of algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience. 14 ML itself may be categorised as \u2018supervised\u2019, \u2018unsupervised\u2019 and \u2018reinforcement learning\u2019 (RL), and there is ongoing research in various sub-fields including \u2018semi-supervised\u2019, \u2018self-supervised\u2019 and \u2018multi-instance\u2019 ML. Supervised learning leverages labelled data (annotated information); for example, using labelled X-ray images of known tumours to detect tumours in new images. 15 \u2018Unsupervised learning\u2019 attempts to extract information from data without labels; for example, categorising groups of patients with similar symptoms to identify a common cause. 16 In RL, computational agents learn by trial and error, or by expert demonstration. The algorithm learns by developing a strategy to maximise rewards. Of note, major breakthroughs in AI in recent years have been based on RL. Deep learning (DL) is a class of algorithms that learns by using a large, many-layered collection of connected processes and exposing these processors to a vast set of examples. DL has emerged as the predominant method in AI today driving improvements in areas such as image and speech recognition. 17,18 How to build effective and trusted AI-augmented healthcare systems? Despite more than a decade of significant focus, the use and adoption of AI in clinical practice remains limited, with many AI products for healthcare still at the design and develop stage. 19\u201322 While there are different ways to build AI systems for healthcare, far too often there are attempts to force square pegs into round holes ie find healthcare problems to apply AI solutions to without due consideration to local context (such as clinical workflows, user needs, trust, safety and ethical implications). We hold the view that AI amplifies and augments, rather than replaces, human intelligence. Hence, when building AI systems in healthcare, it is key to not replace the important elements of the human interaction in medicine but to focus it, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of that interaction. Moreover, AI innovations in healthcare will come through an in-depth, human-centred understanding of the complexity of patient journeys and care pathways. In Fig 1 , we describe a problem-driven, human-centred approach, adapted from frameworks by Wiens et al , Care and Sendak to building effective and reliable AI-augmented healthcare systems. 23\u201325 Fig 1. Open in a new tab Multi-step, iterative approach to build effective and reliable AI-augmented systems in healthcare. Design and develop The first stage is to design and develop AI solutions for the right problems using a human-centred AI and experimentation approach and engaging appropriate stakeholders, especially the healthcare users themselves. Stakeholder engagement and co-creation Build a multidisciplinary team including computer and social scientists, operational and research leadership, and clinical stakeholders (physician, caregivers and patients) and subject experts (eg for biomedical scientists) that would include authorisers, motivators, financiers, conveners, connectors, implementers and champions. 26 A multi-stakeholder team brings the technical, strategic, operational expertise to define problems, goals, success metrics and intermediate milestones. Human-centred AI A human-centred AI approach combines an ethnographic understanding of health systems, with AI. Through user-designed research, first understand the key problems (we suggest using a qualitative study design to understand \u2018what is the problem\u2019, \u2018why is it a problem\u2019, \u2018to whom does it matter\u2019, \u2018why has it not been addressed before\u2019 and \u2018why is it not getting attention\u2019) including the needs, constraints and workflows in healthcare organisations, and the facilitators and barriers to the integration of AI within the clinical context. After defining key problems, the next step is to identify which problems are appropriate for AI to solve, whether there is availability of applicable datasets to build and later evaluate AI. By contextualising algorithms in an existing workflow, AI systems would operate within existing norms and practices to ensure adoption, providing appropriate solutions to existing problems for the end user. Experimentation The focus should be on piloting of new stepwise experiments to build AI tools, using tight feedback loops from stakeholders to facilitate rapid experiential learning and incremental changes. 27 The experiments would allow the trying out of new ideas simultaneously, exploring to see which one works, learn what works and what doesn't, and why. 28 Experimentation and feedback will help to elucidate the purpose and intended uses for the AI system: the likely end users and the potential harm and ethical implications of AI system to them (for instance, data privacy, security, equity and safety). Evaluate and validate Next, we must iteratively evaluate and validate the predictions made by the AI tool to test how well it is functioning. This is critical, and evaluation is based on three dimensions: statistical validity, clinical utility and economic utility. Statistical validity is understanding the performance of AI on metrics of accuracy, reliability, robustness, stability and calibration. High model performance on retrospective, in silico settings is not sufficient to demonstrate clinical utility or impact. To determine clinical utility, evaluate the algorithm in a real-time environment on a hold-out and temporal validation set (eg longitudinal and external geographic datasets) to demonstrate clinical effectiveness and generalisability. 25 Economic utility quantifies the net benefit relative to the cost from the investment in the AI system. Scale and diffuse Many AI systems are initially designed to solve a problem at one healthcare system based on the patient population specific to that location and context. Scale up of AI systems requires special attention to deployment modalities, model updates, the regulatory system, variation between systems and reimbursement environment. Monitor and maintain Even after an AI system has been deployed clinically, it must be continually monitored and maintained to monitor for risks and adverse events using effective post-market surveillance. Healthcare organisations, regulatory bodies and AI developers should cooperate to collate and analyse the relevant datasets for AI performance, clinical and safety-related risks, and adverse events. 29 What are the current and future use cases of AI in healthcare? AI can enable healthcare systems to achieve their \u2018quadruple aim\u2019 by democratising and standardising a future of connected and AI augmented care, precision diagnostics, precision therapeutics and, ultimately, precision medicine (Table 1 ). 30 Research in the application of AI healthcare continues to accelerate rapidly, with potential use cases being demonstrated across the healthcare sector (both physical and mental health) including drug discovery, virtual clinical consultation, disease diagnosis, prognosis, medication management and health monitoring.

We describe a non-exhaustive suite of AI applications in healthcare in the near term, medium term and longer term, for the potential capabilities of AI to augment, automate and transform medicine. AI today (and in the near future) Currently, AI systems are not reasoning engines ie cannot reason the same way as human physicians, who can draw upon \u2018common sense\u2019 or \u2018clinical intuition and experience\u2019. 12 Instead, AI resembles a signal translator, translating patterns from datasets. AI systems today are beginning to be adopted by healthcare organisations to automate time consuming, high volume repetitive tasks. Moreover, there is considerable progress in demonstrating the use of AI in precision diagnostics (eg diabetic retinopathy and radiotherapy planning). AI in the medium term (the next 5\u201310 years) In the medium term, we propose that there will be significant progress in the development of powerful algorithms that are efficient (eg require less data to train), able to use unlabelled data, and can combine disparate structured and unstructured data including imaging, electronic health data, multi-omic, behavioural and pharmacological data. In addition, healthcare organisations and medical practices will evolve from being adopters of AI platforms, to becoming co-innovators with technology partners in the development of novel AI systems for precision therapeutics. AI in the long term (>10 years) In the long term, AI systems will become more intelligent , enabling AI healthcare systems achieve a state of precision medicine through AI-augmented healthcare and connected care. Healthcare will shift from the traditional one-size-fits-all form of medicine to a preventative, personalised, data-driven disease management model that achieves improved patient outcomes (improved patient and clinical experiences of care) in a more cost-effective delivery system. Connected/augmented care AI could significantly reduce inefficiency in healthcare, improve patient flow and experience, and enhance caregiver experience and patient safety through the care pathway; for example, AI could be applied to the remote monitoring of patients (eg intelligent telehealth through wearables/sensors) to identify and provide timely care of patients at risk of deterioration. In the long term, we expect that healthcare clinics, hospitals, social care services, patients and caregivers to be all connected to a single, interoperable digital infrastructure using passive sensors in combination with ambient intelligence. 31 Following are two AI applications in connected care. Virtual assistants and AI chatbots AI chatbots (such as those used in Babylon ( www.babylonhealth.com ) and Ada ( https://ada.com )) are being used by patients to identify symptoms and recommend further actions in community and primary care settings. AI chatbots can be integrated with wearable devices such as smartwatches to provide insights to both patients and caregivers in improving their behaviour, sleep and general wellness. Ambient and intelligent care We also note the emergence of ambient sensing without the need for any peripherals. Emerald ( www.emeraldinno.com ): a wireless, touchless sensor and machine learning platform for remote monitoring of sleep, breathing and behaviour, founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and researchers. Google nest: claiming to monitor sleep (including sleep disturbances like cough) using motion and sound sensors. 32 A recently published article exploring the ability to use smart speakers to contactlessly monitor heart rhythms. 33 Automation and ambient clinical intelligence: AI systems leveraging natural language processing (NLP) technology have the potential to automate administrative tasks such as documenting patient visits in electronic health records, optimising clinical workflow and enabling clinicians to focus more time on caring for patients (eg Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience ( www.nuance.com/healthcare/ambient-clinical-intelligence.html )). Precision diagnostics Diagnostic imaging The automated classification of medical images is the leading AI application today. A recent review of AI/ML-based medical devices approved in the USA and Europe from 2015\u20132020 found that more than half (129 (58%) devices in the USA and 126 (53%) devices in Europe) were approved or CE marked for radiological use. 34 Studies have demonstrated AI's ability to meet or exceed the performance of human experts in image-based diagnoses from several medical specialties including pneumonia in radiology (a convolutional neural network trained with labelled frontal chest X-ray images outperformed radiologists in detecting pneumonia), dermatology (a convolutional neural network was trained with clinical images and was found to classify skin lesions accurately), pathology (one study trained AI algorithms with whole-slide pathology images to detect lymph node metastases of breast cancer and compared the results with those of pathologists) and cardiology (a deep learning algorithm diagnosed heart attack with a performance comparable with that of cardiologists). 35\u201338 We recognise that there are some exemplars in this area in the NHS (eg University of Leeds Virtual Pathology Project and the National Pathology Imaging Co-operative) and expect widescale adoption and scaleup of AI-based diagnostic imaging in the medium term. 39 We provide two use cases of such technologies. Diabetic retinopathy screening Key to reducing preventable, diabetes-related vision loss worldwide is screening individuals for detection and the prompt treatment of diabetic retinopathy. However, screening is costly given the substantial number of diabetes patients and limited manpower for eye care worldwide. 40 Research studies on automated AI algorithms for diabetic retinopathy in the USA, Singapore, Thailand and India have demonstrated robust diagnostic performance and cost effectiveness. 41\u201344 Moreover, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved Medicare reimbursement for the use of Food and Drug Administration approved AI algorithm \u2018IDx-DR\u2019, which demonstrated 87% sensitivity and 90% specificity for detecting more-than-mild diabetic retinopathy. 45 Improving the precision and reducing waiting timings for radiotherapy planning An important AI application is to assist clinicians for image preparation and planning tasks for radiotherapy cancer treatment. Currently, segmentation of the images is time consuming and laborious task, performed manually by an oncologist using specially designed software to draw contours around the regions of interest. The AI-based InnerEye open-source technology can cut this preparation time for head and neck, and prostate cancer by up to 90%, meaning that waiting times for starting potentially life-saving radiotherapy treatment can be dramatically reduced (Fig 2 ). 46,47 Fig 2. Open in a new tab Potential applications for the InnerEye deep learning toolkit include quantitative radiology for monitoring tumour progression, planning for surgery and radiotherapy planning. 47 Precision therapeutics To make progress towards precision therapeutics, we need to considerably improve our understanding of disease. Researchers globally are exploring the cellular and molecular basis of disease, collecting a range of multimodal datasets that can lead to digital and biological biomarkers for diagnosis, severity and progression. Two important future AI applications include immunomics / synthetic biology and drug discovery. Immunomics and synthetic biology Through the application of AI tools on multimodal datasets in the future, we may be able to better understand the cellular basis of disease and the clustering of diseases and patient populations to provide more targeted preventive strategies, for example, using immunomics to diagnose and better predict care and treatment options. This will be revolutionary for multiple standards of care, with particular impact in the cancer, neurological and rare disease space, personalising the experience of care for the individual. AI-driven drug discovery AI will drive significant improvement in clinical trial design and optimisation of drug manufacturing processes, and, in general, any combinatorial optimisation process in healthcare could be replaced by AI. We have already seen the beginnings of this with the recent announcements by DeepMind and AlphaFold, which now sets the stage for better understanding disease processes, predicting protein structures and developing more targeted therapeutics (for both rare and more common diseases; Fig 3 ). 48,49 Fig 3. Open in a new tab An overview of the main neural network model architecture for AlphaFold. 49 MSA = multiple sequence alignment. Precision medicine New curative therapies Over the past decade, synthetic biology has produced developments like CRISPR gene editing and some personalised cancer therapies. However, the life cycle for developing such advanced therapies is still extremely inefficient and expensive. In future, with better access to data (genomic, proteomic, glycomic, metabolomic and bioinformatic), AI will allow us to handle far more systematic complexity and, in turn, help us transform the way we understand, discover and affect biology. This will improve the efficiency of the drug discovery process by helping better predict early which agents are more likely to be effective and also better anticipate adverse drug effects, which have often thwarted the further development of otherwise effective drugs at a costly late stage in the development process. This, in turn will democratise access to novel advanced therapies at a lower cost. AI empowered healthcare professionals In the longer term, healthcare professionals will leverage AI in augmenting the care they provide, allowing them to provide safer, standardised and more effective care at the top of their licence; for example, clinicians could use an \u2018AI digital consult\u2019 to examine \u2018digital twin\u2019 models of their patients (a truly \u2018digital and biomedical\u2019 version of a patient), allowing them to \u2018test\u2019 the effectiveness, safety and experience of an intervention (such as a cancer drug) in the digital environment prior to delivering the intervention to the patient in the real world. Challenges We recognise that there are significant challenges related to the wider adoption and deployment of AI into healthcare systems. These challenges include, but are not limited to, data quality and access, technical infrastructure, organisational capacity, and ethical and responsible practices in addition to aspects related to safety and regulation. Some of these issues have been covered, but others go beyond the scope of this current article. Conclusion and key recommendations Advances in AI have the potential to transform many aspects of healthcare, enabling a future that is more personalised, precise, predictive and portable. It is unclear if we will see an incremental adoption of new technologies or radical adoption of these technological innovations, but the impact of such technologies and the digital renaissance they bring requires health systems to consider how best they will adapt to the changing landscape. For the NHS, the application of such technologies truly has the potential to release time for care back to healthcare professionals, enabling them to focus on what matters to their patients and, in the future, leveraging a globally democratised set of data assets comprising the \u2018highest levels of human knowledge\u2019 to \u2018work at the limits of science\u2019 to deliver a common high standard of care, wherever and whenever it is delivered, and by whoever. 50 Globally, AI could become a key tool for improving health equity around the world. As much as the last 10 years have been about the roll out of digitisation of health records for the purposes of efficiency (and in some healthcare systems, billing/reimbursement), the next 10 years will be about the insight and value society can gain from these digital assets, and how these can be translated into driving better clinical outcomes with the assistance of AI, and the subsequent creation of novel data assets and tools. It is clear that we are at an turning point as it relates to the convergence of the practice of medicine and the application of technology, and although there are multiple opportunities, there are formidable challenges that need to be overcome as it relates to the real world and the scale of implementation of such innovation. A key to delivering this vision will be an expansion of translational research in the field of healthcare applications of artificial intelligence. Alongside this, we need investment into the upskilling of a healthcare workforce and future leaders that are digitally enabled, and to understand and embrace, rather than being intimidated by, the potential of an AI-augmented healthcare system. Healthcare leaders should consider (as a minimum) these issues when planning to leverage AI for health: processes for ethical and responsible access to data: healthcare data is highly sensitive, inconsistent, siloed and not optimised for the purposes of machine learning development, evaluation, implementation and adoption access to domain expertise / prior knowledge to make sense and create some of the rules which need to be applied to the datasets (to generate the necessary insight) access to sufficient computing power to generate decisions in real time, which is being transformed exponentially with the advent of cloud computing research into implementation: critically, we must consider, explore and research issues which arise when you take the algorithm and put it in the real world, building \u2018trusted\u2019 AI algorithms embedded into appropriate workflows.

In some cases, it can exceed or augment human capabilities by providing better or faster ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] As the widespread use of AI in healthcare is still relatively new, research is ongoing into its applications across various medical subdisciplines and related industries. AI programs are being applied to practices such as diagnostics , [ 4 ] treatment protocol development, [ 5 ] drug development , [ 6 ] personalized medicine , [ 7 ] and patient monitoring and care. [ 8 ] Since radiographs are the most commonly performed imaging tests in radiology, the potential for AI to assist with triage and interpretation of radiographs is particularly significant. [ 9 ] Using AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy , automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases . [ 10 ] Furthermore, new technologies such as AI are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption. [ 11 ] In contrast, there are also several cases where AI has been put to use in healthcare without proper testing. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic. [ 16 ] Moreover, meta-studies have found that the scientific literature on AI in healthcare often suffers from a lack of reproducibility . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Applications in healthcare systems [ edit ] Disease diagnosis [ edit ] Accurate and early diagnosis of diseases is still a challenge in healthcare. Recognizing medical conditions and their symptoms is a complex problem. AI can assist clinicians with its data processing capabilities to save time and improve accuracy. [ 21 ] Through the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence can be able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the analysis of mass electronic health records (EHRs). [ 22 ] AI can help early prediction, for example, of Alzheimer's disease and dementias , by looking through large numbers of similar cases and possible treatments. [ 23 ] AI can aid doctors' decision-making in emergency cases, for example, in emergency departments. AI algorithms may assist in prioritizing critical cases, cutting down waiting times. Also, AI-backed decision support systems make recommendations instantly and enable quicker interpretation of data, which supports healthcare professionals' decisions. [ 21 ] In 2023 a study reported higher satisfaction rates with ChatGPT -generated responses compared with those from physicians for medical questions posted on Reddit \u2019s r/AskDocs. [ 24 ] Evaluators preferred ChatGPT's responses to physician responses in 78.6% of 585 evaluations, noting better quality and empathy. The authors noted that these were isolated questions taken from an online forum, not in the context of an established patient-physician relationship. [ 24 ] Moreover, responses were not graded on the accuracy of medical information, and some have argued that the experiment was not properly blinded , with the evaluators being coauthors of the study. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Recent developments in statistical physics , machine learning , and inference algorithms are also being explored for their potential in improving medical diagnostic approaches. [ 28 ] Also, the establishment of large healthcare-related data warehouses of sometimes hundreds of millions of patients provides extensive training data for AI models. [ 29 ] Electronic health records [ edit ] Electronic health records (EHR) are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. Now that around 80% of medical practices use EHR, some anticipate the use of artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians. [ 30 ] One application uses natural language processing (NLP) to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms. [ 30 ] For example, the term heart attack and myocardial infarction mean the same things, but physicians may use one over the other based on personal preferences. [ 30 ] NLP algorithms consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed. [ 30 ] Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician's notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read. [ 30 ] Other applications use concept processing to analyze the information entered by the current patient's doctor to present similar cases and help the physician remember to include all relevant details. [ 31 ] Beyond making content edits to an EHR, there are AI algorithms that evaluate an individual patient's record and predict a risk for a disease based on their previous information and family history. [ 32 ] One general algorithm is a rule-based system that makes decisions similarly to how humans use flow charts. [ 33 ] This system takes in large amounts of data and creates a set of rules that connect specific observations to concluded diagnoses. [ 33 ] Thus, the algorithm can take in a new patient's data and try to predict the likeliness that they will have a certain condition or disease. [ 33 ] Since the algorithms can evaluate a patient's information based on collective data, they can find any outstanding issues to bring to a physician's attention and save time. [ 32 ] One study conducted by the Centerstone research institute found that predictive modeling of EHR data has achieved 70\u201372% accuracy in predicting individualized treatment response. [ 34 ] These methods are helpful due to the fact that the amount of online health records doubles every five years. [ 32 ] Physicians do not have the bandwidth to process all this data manually, and AI can leverage this data to assist physicians in treating their patients. [ 32 ] Drug interactions [ edit ] Improvements in natural language processing led to the development of algorithms to identify drug-drug interactions in medical literature. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Drug-drug interactions pose a threat to those taking multiple medications simultaneously, and the danger increases with the number of medications being taken. [ 39 ] To address the difficulty of tracking all known or suspected drug-drug interactions, machine learning algorithms have been created to extract information on interacting drugs and their possible effects from medical literature. Efforts were consolidated in 2013 in the DDIExtraction Challenge, in which a team of researchers at Carlos III University assembled a corpus of literature on drug-drug interactions to form a standardized test for such algorithms. [ 40 ] Competitors were tested on their ability to accurately determine, from the text, which drugs were shown to interact and what the characteristics of their interactions were. [ 41 ] Researchers continue to use this corpus to standardize the measurement of the effectiveness of their algorithms. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 38 ] Other algorithms identify drug-drug interactions from patterns in user-generated content , especially electronic health records and/or adverse event reports. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Organizations such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the World Health Organization's VigiBase allow doctors to submit reports of possible negative reactions to medications. Deep learning algorithms have been developed to parse these reports and detect patterns that imply drug-drug interactions. [ 42 ] Telemedicine [ edit ] An elderly man using a pulse oximeter to measure his blood oxygen levels The increase of telemedicine , the treatment of patients remotely, has shown the rise of possible AI applications. [ 43 ] AI can assist in caring for patients remotely by monitoring their information through sensors. [ 44 ] A wearable device may allow for constant monitoring of a patient and the ability to notice changes that may be less distinguishable by humans. The information can be compared to other data that has already been collected using artificial intelligence algorithms that alert physicians if there are any issues to be aware of. [ 44 ] Another application of artificial intelligence is chat-bot therapy. Some researchers charge that the reliance on chatbots for mental healthcare does not offer the reciprocity and accountability of care that should exist in the relationship between the consumer of mental healthcare and the care provider (be it a chat-bot or psychologist), though. [ 45 ] Some examples of these chatbots include Woebot, Earkick and Wysa. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Since the average age has risen due to a longer life expectancy, artificial intelligence could be useful in helping take care of older populations. [ 49 ] Tools such as environment and personal sensors can identify a person's regular activities and alert a caretaker if a behavior or a measured vital is abnormal. [ 49 ] Although the technology is useful, there are also discussions about limitations of monitoring in order to respect a person's privacy since there are technologies that are designed to map out home layouts and detect human interactions. [ 49 ] Workload management [ edit ] AI has the potential to streamline care coordination and reduce the workload. AI algorithms can automate administrative tasks, prioritize patient needs and facilitate seamless communication in a healthcare team. [ 50 ] This enables healthcare providers to focus more on direct patient care and ensures the efficient and coordinated delivery of healthcare services. Clinical applications [ edit ] Cardiovascular [ edit ] Artificial intelligence algorithms have shown promising results in accurately diagnosing and risk stratifying patients with concern for coronary artery disease, showing potential as an initial triage tool. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Other algorithms have been used in predicting patient mortality, medication effects, and adverse events following treatment for acute coronary syndrome . [ 51 ] Wearables, smartphones, and internet-based technologies have also shown the ability to monitor patients' cardiac data points, expanding the amount of data and the various settings AI models can use and potentially enabling earlier detection of cardiac events occurring outside of the hospital. [ 53 ] A research in 2019 found that AI can be used to predict heart attack with up to 90% accuracy. [ 54 ] Another growing area of research is the utility of AI in classifying heart sounds and diagnosing valvular disease . [ 55 ] Challenges of AI in cardiovascular medicine have included the limited data available to train machine learning models, such as limited data on social determinants of health as they pertain to cardiovascular disease . [ 56 ] A key limitation in early studies evaluating AI were omissions of data comparing algorithmic performance to humans. Examples of studies which assess AI performance relative to physicians includes how AI is non-inferior to humans in interpretation of cardiac echocardiograms [ 57 ] and that AI can diagnose heart attack better than human physicians in the emergency setting, reducing both low-value testing and missed diagnoses. [ 58 ] In cardiovascular tissue engineering and organoid studies, AI is increasingly used to analyze microscopy images, and integrate electrophysiological read outs. [ 59 ] Dermatology [ edit ] Medical imaging (such as X-ray and photography) is a commonly used tool in dermatology [ 60 ] and the development of deep learning has been strongly tied to image\u00a0processing . Therefore, there is a natural fit between the dermatology and deep learning. Machine learning learning holds great potential to process these images for better diagnoses. [ 61 ] Han et al. showed keratinocytic skin cancer detection from face photographs. [ 62 ] Esteva et al. demonstrated dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer from lesion images. [ 63 ] Noyan et al. demonstrated a convolutional neural network that achieved 94% accuracy at identifying skin cells from microscopic Tzanck smear images. [ 64 ] A concern raised with this work is that it has not engaged with disparities related to skin color or differential treatment of patients with non-white skin tones. [ 65 ] According to some researchers, AI algorithms have been shown to be more effective than dermatologists at identifying cancer. [ 66 ] However, a 2021 review article found that a majority of papers analyzing the performance of AI algorithms designed for skin cancer classification failed to use external test sets. [ 67 ] Only four research studies were found in which the AI algorithms were tested on clinics, regions, or populations distinct from those it was trained on, and in each of those four studies, the performance of dermatologists was found to be on par with that of the algorithm. Moreover, only one study [ 68 ] was set in the context of a full clinical examination; others were based on interaction through web-apps or online questionnaires, with most based entirely on context-free images of lesions. In this study, it was found that dermatologists significantly outperformed the algorithms. Many articles claiming superior performance of AI algorithms also fail to distinguish between trainees and board-certified dermatologists in their analyses. [ 67 ] It has also been suggested that AI could be used to automatically evaluate the outcome of maxillo-facial surgery or cleft palate therapy in regard to facial attractiveness or age appearance. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Gastroenterology [ edit ] AI can play a role in various facets of the field of gastroenterology . Endoscopic exams such as esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD) and colonoscopies rely on rapid detection of abnormal tissue. By enhancing these endoscopic procedures with AI, clinicians can more rapidly identify diseases, determine their severity, and visualize blind spots. Early trials in using AI detection systems of early stomach cancer have shown sensitivity close to expert endoscopists. [ 71 ] AI can assist doctors treating ulcerative colitis in detecting the microscopic activity of the disease in people and predicting when flare-ups will happen. For example, an AI-powered tool  was developed to analyse digitised bowel samples ( biopsies ). The tool was able to distinguish with 80% accuracy between samples that show remission of colitis and those with active disease. It also predicted the risk of a flare-up happening with the same accuracy. These rates of successfully using microscopic disease activity to predict disease flare are similar to the accuracy of pathologists . [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Obstetrics and gynaecology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence utilises massive amounts of data to help with predicting illness, prevention, and diagnosis, as well as patient monitoring. In obstetrics, artificial intelligence is utilized in magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and foetal cardiotocography. AI contributes in the resolution of a variety of obstetrical diagnostic issues. [ 74 ] Infectious diseases [ edit ] AI has shown potential in both the laboratory and clinical spheres of infectious disease medicine. [ 75 ] During the COVID-19 pandemic , AI has been used for early detection, tracking virus spread and analysing virus behaviour, among other things. [ 76 ] However, there were only a few examples of AI being used directly in clinical practice during the pandemic itself. [ 77 ] Other applications  of AI around infectious diseases include support-vector machines identifying antimicrobial resistance , machine learning analysis of blood smears to detect malaria , and improved point-of-care testing of Lyme disease based on antigen detection. Additionally, AI has been investigated for improving diagnosis of meningitis , sepsis , and tuberculosis , as well as predicting treatment complications in hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients. [ 75 ] Musculoskeletal [ edit ] AI has been used to identify causes of knee pain that doctors miss, that disproportionately affect Black patients. [ 78 ] Underserved populations experience higher levels of pain. These disparities persist even after controlling for the objective severity of diseases like osteoarthritis, as graded by human physicians using medical images, raising the possibility that underserved patients\u2019 pain stems from factors external to the knee, such as stress. Researchers have conducted a study using a machine-learning algorithm to show that standard radiographic measures of severity overlook objective but undiagnosed features that disproportionately affect diagnosis and management of underserved populations with knee pain. They proposed that new algorithmic measure ALG-P could potentially enable expanded access to treatments for underserved patients. [ 79 ] Neurology [ edit ] The use of AI technologies has been explored for use in the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For diagnostic purposes, machine learning models have been developed that rely on structural MRI inputs. [ 80 ] The input datasets for these models are drawn from databases such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. [ 81 ] Researchers have developed models that rely on convolutional neural networks with the aim of improving early diagnostic accuracy. [ 82 ] Generative adversarial networks are a form of deep learning that have also performed well in diagnosing AD. [ 83 ] There have also been efforts to develop machine learning models into forecasting tools that can predict the prognosis of patients with AD. Forecasting patient outcomes through generative models has been proposed by researchers as a means of synthesizing training and validation sets. [ 84 ] They suggest that generated patient forecasts could be used to provide future models larger training datasets than current open access databases. Oncology [ edit ] AI has been explored for use in cancer diagnosis, risk stratification, molecular characterization of tumors, and cancer drug discovery. A particular challenge in oncologic care that AI is being developed to address is the ability to accurately predict which treatment protocols will be best suited for each patient based on their individual genetic, molecular, and tumor-based characteristics. [ 85 ] AI has been trialed in cancer diagnostics with the reading of imaging studies and pathology slides. [ 86 ] In January 2020, Google DeepMind announced an algorithm capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer detection in screening scans. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] A number of researchers, including Trevor Hastie , Joelle Pineau , and Robert Tibshirani among others, published a reply claiming that DeepMind's research publication in Nature lacked key details on methodology and code, \"effectively undermin[ing] its scientific value\" and making it impossible for the scientific community to confirm the work. [ 89 ] In the MIT Technology Review , author Benjamin Haibe-Kains characterized DeepMind's work as \"an advertisement\" having little to do with science. [ 90 ] In July 2020, it was reported that an AI algorithm developed by the University of Pittsburgh achieves the highest accuracy to date in identifying prostate cancer , with 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] In 2023 a study reported the use of AI for CT -based radiomics classification at grading the aggressiveness of retroperitoneal sarcoma with 82% accuracy compared with 44% for lab analysis of biopsies. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Ophthalmology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence-enhanced technology is being used as an aid in the screening of eye disease and prevention of blindness. [ 95 ] In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the marketing of the first medical device to diagnose a specific type of eye disease, diabetic retinopathy using an artificial intelligence algorithm. [ 96 ] Moreover, AI technology may be used to further improve \"diagnosis rates\" because of the potential to decrease detection time. [ 97 ] Pathology [ edit ] Further information: Digital pathology Ki67 stain calculation by the open-source software QuPath in a pure seminoma, which gives a measure of the proliferation rate of the tumor. The colors represent the intensity of expression: blue-no expression, yellow-low, orange-moderate, and red-high expression. [ 98 ] For many diseases, pathological analysis of cells and tissues is considered to be the gold standard of disease diagnosis. Methods of digital pathology allows microscopy slides to be scanned and digitally analyzed. AI-assisted pathology tools have been developed to assist with the diagnosis of a number of diseases, including breast cancer, hepatitis B, gastric cancer , and colorectal cancer . AI has also been used to predict genetic mutations and prognosticate disease outcomes. [ 71 ] AI is well-suited for use in low-complexity pathological analysis of large-scale screening samples, such as colorectal or breast cancer screening, thus lessening the burden on pathologists and allowing for faster turnaround of sample analysis. [ 99 ] Several deep learning and artificial neural network models have shown accuracy similar to that of human pathologists, [ 99 ] and a study of deep learning assistance in diagnosing metastatic breast cancer in lymph nodes showed that the accuracy of humans with the assistance of a deep learning program was higher than either the humans alone or the AI program alone. [ 100 ] Additionally, implementation of digital pathology is predicted to save over $12 million for a university center over the course of five years, [ 101 ] though savings attributed to AI specifically have not yet been widely researched. The use of augmented and virtual reality could prove to be a stepping stone to wider implementation of AI-assisted pathology, as they can highlight areas of concern on a pathology sample and present them in real-time to a pathologist for more efficient review. [ 99 ] AI also has the potential to identify histological findings at levels beyond what the human eye can see, [ 99 ] and has shown the ability to use genotypic and phenotypic data to more accurately detect the tumor of origin for metastatic cancer. [ 102 ] One of the major current barriers to widespread implementation of AI-assisted pathology tools is the lack of prospective, randomized, multi-center controlled trials in determining the true clinical utility of AI for pathologists and patients, highlighting a current area of need in AI and healthcare research. [ 99 ] Primary care [ edit ] Primary care has become one key development area for AI technologies. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] AI in primary care has been used for supporting decision making, predictive modeling, and business analytics. [ 105 ] There are only a few examples of AI decision support systems that were prospectively assessed on clinical efficacy when used in practice by physicians. But there are cases where the use of these systems yielded a positive effect on treatment choice by physicians. [ 106 ] As of 2022 in relation to elder care, AI robots had been helpful in guiding older residents living in assisted living with entertainment and company. These bots are allowing staff in the home to have more one-on-one time with each resident, but the bots are also programmed with more ability in what they are able to do; such as knowing different languages and different types of care depending on the patient's conditions. The bot is an AI machine, which means it goes through the same training as any other machine - using algorithms to parse the given data, learn from it and predict the outcome in relation to what situation is at hand. [ 107 ] Psychiatry [ edit ] In psychiatry, AI applications are still in a phase of proof-of-concept. [ 108 ] Areas where the evidence is widening quickly include predictive modelling of diagnosis and treatment outcomes, [ 109 ] chatbots, conversational agents that imitate human behaviour and which have been studied for anxiety and depression. [ 110 ] Challenges include the fact that many applications in the field are developed and proposed by private corporations, such as the screening for suicidal ideation implemented by Facebook in 2017. [ 111 ] Such applications outside the healthcare system raise various professional, ethical and regulatory questions. [ 112 ] Another issue is often with the validity and interpretability of the models. Small training datasets contain bias that is inherited by the models, and compromises the generalizability and stability of these models. Such models may also have the potential to be discriminatory against minority groups that are underrepresented in samples. [ 113 ] In 2023, US-based National Eating Disorders Association replaced its human helpline staff with a chatbot but had to take it offline after users reported receiving harmful advice from it. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] Radiology [ edit ] AI is being studied within the field of radiology to detect and diagnose diseases through computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. [ 117 ] It may be particularly useful in settings where demand for human expertise exceeds supply, or where data is too complex to be efficiently interpreted by human readers. [ 118 ] Several deep learning models have shown the capability to be roughly as accurate as healthcare professionals in identifying diseases through medical imaging, though few of the studies reporting these findings have been externally validated. [ 119 ] AI can also provide non-interpretive benefit to radiologists, such as reducing noise in images, creating high-quality images from lower doses of radiation, enhancing MR image quality, [ 120 ] and automatically assessing image quality. [ 121 ] Further research investigating the use of AI in nuclear medicine focuses on image reconstruction, anatomical landmarking, and the enablement of lower doses in imaging studies. [ 122 ] The analysis of images for supervised AI applications in radiology encompasses two primary techniques at present: (1) convolutional neural network-based analysis; and (2) utilization of radiomics . [ 118 ] AI is also used in breast imaging for analyzing screening mammograms and can participate in improving breast cancer detection rate [ 123 ] as well as reducing radiologist's reading workload. Pharmacy [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Artificial intelligence in pharmacy . [ edit ] This article may require copy editing for grammar, style, cohesion, tone, or spelling . You can assist by editing it . ( May 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Part of a series on Artificial intelligence (AI) Major goals Artificial general intelligence Intelligent agent Recursive self-improvement Planning Computer vision General game playing Knowledge representation Natural language processing Robotics AI safety Approaches Machine learning Symbolic Deep learning Bayesian networks Evolutionary algorithms Hybrid intelligent systems Systems integration Applications Bioinformatics Deepfake Earth sciences Finance Generative AI Art Audio Music Government Healthcare Mental health Industry Translation Military Physics Projects Philosophy Artificial consciousness Chinese room Friendly AI Control problem / Takeover Ethics Existential risk Turing test Uncanny valley History Timeline Progress AI winter AI boom Glossary Glossary v t e Artificial Intelligence (AI) [ 124 ] [ 125 ] [ 126 ] is a field of computer science in which a huge amount of data is fed to a machine learning model, which allows the machine to learn patterns from that data and is able to make smart, calculated decisions, which can only be achieved by human intelligence . Artificial intelligence is playing a crucial role in driving the application and research in many fields and pharmacy is no exception. In pharmacy, the use of AI is leading to the discovery, development, and delivery of medications , and also enhancing patient care through personalized treatment plans. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] This article is going to summarize AI's application in drug research, drug safety, dose recommendation and examine the limitations and future directions of AI in pharmacy. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Industry [ edit ] The trend of large health companies merging allows for greater health data accessibility. Greater health data lays the groundwork for the implementation of AI algorithms. A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the clinical decision support systems . As more data is collected, machine learning algorithms adapt and allow for more robust responses and solutions. [ 117 ] Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of big data in the healthcare industry. Many companies investigate the market opportunities through the realms of \"data assessment, storage, management, and analysis technologies\" which are all crucial parts of the healthcare industry. [ 131 ] With the market for AI expanding constantly, large tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Baidu all have their own AI research divisions, as well as millions of dollars allocated for acquisition of smaller AI based companies. [ 131 ] The following are examples of large companies that are contributing to AI algorithms for use in healthcare: Amazon Web Services [ 132 ] Apple [ 132 ] Google 's DeepMind platform is being used by the UK National Health Service to detect certain health risks through data collected via a mobile app. A second project with the NHS involves the analysis of medical images collected from NHS patients to develop computer vision algorithms to detect cancerous tissues. IBM's Watson Oncology is in development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Cleveland Clinic . IBM is also working with CVS Health on AI applications in chronic disease treatment and with Johnson & Johnson on analysis of scientific papers to find new connections for drug development. In May 2017, IBM and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute began a joint project entitled Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning and Semantics (HEALS) , to explore using AI technology to enhance healthcare. Intel's venture capital arm Intel Capital invested in 2016 in the startup Lumiata, which uses AI to identify at-risk patients and develop care options. [ 133 ] Meta [ 132 ] Microsoft 's Hanover project, in partnership with Oregon Health & Science University 's Knight Cancer Institute, analyzes medical research to predict the most effective cancer drug treatment options for patients. Other projects include medical image analysis of tumor progression and the development of programmable cells. [ 134 ] Neuralink has come up with a next-generation neuroprosthetic which intricately interfaces with thousands of neural pathways in the brain. [ 117 ] Their process allows a chip, roughly the size of a quarter, to be inserted in the place of a chunk of a skull by a precision surgical robot to avoid accidental injury . [ 117 ] Elon Musk premiering the surgical robot that implants the Neuralink brain chip Ava Industries Ltd., a Canadian healthcare technology firm, is developing integrated AI tools to support clinical efficiency. Ava has implemented an embedded AI medical scribe within theis electronic medical record system (EMR) and is further developing tools such as an AI chart summarizer and an AI document classifier. [1] The company has received support through grants from Canada Health Infowayfor its work in advancing digital health solutions. [2] Tencent is working on several medical systems and services. These include AI Medical Innovation System (AIMIS) , an AI-powered diagnostic medical imaging service; WeChat Intelligent Healthcare; and Tencent Doctorwork Digital consultant apps use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user's medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution[ buzzword ] to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user (e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus) and value capturing mechanisms (e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders). IFlytek launched a service robot \"Xiao Man\", which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas. [ citation needed ] It also works in the field of medical imaging. Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH (\"Cruzr\") and Softbank Robotics (\"Pepper\"). [ citation needed ] The Indian startup Haptik developed a WhatsApp chatbot in 2021 which answers questions associated with the deadly coronavirus in India . Similarly, a software platform ChatBot in partnership with medtech startup Infermedica launched COVID-19 Risk Assessment ChatBot. [ 135 ] Many automobile manufacturers are beginning to use machine learning healthcare in their cars as well. [ 131 ] Companies such as BMW , GE , Tesla , Toyota , and Volvo all have new research campaigns to find ways of learning a driver's vital statistics to ensure they are awake, paying attention to the road, and not under the influence of substances. [ 131 ] Expanding care to developing nations [ edit ] Artificial intelligence continues to expand in its abilities to diagnose more people accurately in nations where fewer doctors are accessible to the public.\u00a0 Many new technology companies such as SpaceX and the Raspberry Pi Foundation have enabled more developing countries to have access to computers and the internet than ever before. [ 136 ] With the increasing capabilities of AI over the internet, advanced machine learning algorithms can allow patients to get accurately diagnosed when they would previously have no way of knowing if they had a life-threatening disease or not. [ 136 ] Using AI in developing nations that do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can improve patient care. AI can allow for not only diagnosis of patient in areas where healthcare is scarce, but also allow for a good patient experience by resourcing files to find the best treatment for a patient. [ 137 ] The ability of AI to adjust course as it goes also allows the patient to have their treatment modified based on what works for them; a level of individualized care that is nearly non-existent in developing countries. [ 137 ] Regulation [ edit ] This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( May 2025 ) Challenges of the clinical use of AI have brought about a potential need for regulations . AI studies need to be completely and transparently reported to have value to inform regulatory approval. Depending on the phase of study, international consensus-based reporting guidelines (TRIPOD+AI, [ 138 ] DECIDE-AI, [ 139 ] CONSORT-AI [ 140 ] ) have been developed to provide recommendations on the key details that need to be reported. A man speaking at the GDPR compliance workshop at the 2019 Entrepreneurship Summit While regulations exist pertaining to the collection of patient data such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the US ( HIPAA ) and the European General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) pertaining to patients within the EU, health care AI is \u201c\"severely under-regulated worldwide\" as of 2025. [ 132 ] Unclear is whether healthcare AI can be classified merely as software or as medical device . [ 132 ] United Nations (WHO/ITU) [ edit ] The joint ITU - WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H) has built a platform - known as the ITU-WHO AI for Health Framework - for the testing and benchmarking of AI applications in health domain. As of November 2018, eight use cases are being benchmarked, including assessing breast cancer risk from histopathological imagery, guiding anti-venom selection from snake images, and diagnosing skin lesions. USA [ edit ] United States Food & Drug Administration [ 141 ] In 2015, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued rules and regulations to protect the privacy of individuals\u2019 health information,  requiring healthcare providers to follow certain privacy rules when using AI, to keep a record of how they use AI and to ensure that their AI systems are secure. [ 142 ] In May 2016, the White House announced its plan to host a series of workshops and formation of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. [ citation needed ] In October 2016, the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, outlining its proposed priorities for Federally-funded AI research and development (within government and academia). The report notes a strategic R&D plan for the subfield of health information technology was in development stages. [ citation needed ] In January 2021, the US FDA published a new Action Plan, entitled Artificial Intelligence (AI) /Machine Learning (ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) Action Plan. [ 143 ] It layed out the FDA's future plans for regulation of medical devices that would include artificial intelligence in their software with five main actions: 1. Tailored Regulatory Framework for Ai/M:-based SaMD, 2. Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP), 3. Patient-Centered Approach Incorporating Transparency to Users, 4. Regulatory Science Methods Related to Algorithm Bias & Robustness, and 5. Real-World Performance(RWP). This plan was in direct response to stakeholders' feedback on a 2019 discussion paper also published by the FDA. [ 143 ] Under President Biden the DHSS and the National Institute of Standards and Technology were instructed to develop regulation of healthcare AI. [ 132 ] According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , the OCR issued guidance on the ethical use of AI in healthcare in 2021. It outlined four core ethical principles that must be followed: respect for autonomy , beneficence (ethics) , non-maleficence , and justice. Respect for autonomy requires that individuals have control over their own data and decisions. Beneficence requires that AI be used to do good, such as improving the quality of care and reducing health disparities. Non-maleficence requires that AI be used to do no harm, such as avoiding discrimination in decisions. Finally, justice requires that AI be used fairly, such as using the same standards for decisions no matter a person's race, gender, or income level. As of March 2021, the OCR had hired a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (OCAIO) to pursue the \"implementation of the HHS AI strategy\". [ 144 ] With the second Trump administration deregulation of health AI began on January 20, 2025 with merely voluntary standards for collecting and sharing data, statutory definitions for algorithmic discrimination, automation bias, and equity being cancelled, cuts to NIST and 19% of FDA workforce eliminated. [ 132 ] Europe [ edit ] Other countries have implemented data protection regulations, more specifically with company privacy invasions. In Denmark, the Danish Expert Group on data ethics has adopted recommendations on 'Data for the Benefit of the People'. These recommendations are intended to encourage the responsible use of data in the business sector, with a focus on data processing. The recommendations include a focus on equality and non-discrimination with regard to bias in AI, as well as human dignity which is to outweigh profit and must be respected in all data processes. [ 145 ] The European Union has implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect citizens' personal data, which applies to the use of AI in healthcare. In addition, the European Commission has established guidelines to ensure the ethical development of AI, including the use of algorithms to ensure fairness and transparency. [ 146 ] With GDPR, the European Union was the first to regulate AI through data protection legislation. The Union finds privacy as a fundamental human right, it wants to prevent unconsented and secondary uses of data by private or public health facilities. By streamlining access to personal data for health research and findings, they are able to instate the right and importance of patient privacy. [ 146 ] In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires organizations to protect the privacy and security of patient information. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have also released guidelines for the development of AI-based medical applications. [ 147 ] In 2025, Europe was leading the USA on AI regulation, while lagging in innovation and at least one California-based biotech company was \"engaging the European Medicines Agency earlier in development than previously anticipated to mitigate concerns about the FDA's ability to meet development timelines.\" [ 132 ] Ethical concerns [ edit ] While research on the use of AI in healthcare aims to validate its efficacy in improving patient outcomes before its broader adoption, its use may introduce several new types of risk to patients and healthcare providers, such as algorithmic bias , Do not resuscitate implications, and other machine morality issues. AI may also compromise the protection of patients' rights, such as the right to informed consent and the right to medical data protection. [ 148 ] Data collection, privacy - autonomy [ edit ] In order to effectively train Machine Learning and use AI in healthcare, massive amounts of data must be gathered. Acquiring this data, however, comes at the cost of patient privacy , i.e. autonomy in most cases and is not well received publicly. For example, a survey conducted in the UK estimated that 63% of the population is uncomfortable with sharing their personal data in order to improve artificial intelligence technology. [ 149 ] The scarcity of real, accessible patient data is a hindrance that deters the progress of developing and deploying more artificial intelligence in healthcare. The lack of regulations surrounding AI in the United States has generated concerns about mismanagement of patient data, such as with corporations utilizing patient data for financial gain. For example, as of 2020 Roche , a Swiss healthcare company, was found to have purchased healthcare data for approximately 2 million cancer patients at an estimated total cost of $1.9 billion. [ 150 ] Naturally, this generates questions of ethical concern; Is there a monetary price that can be set for data, and should it depend on its perceived value or contributions to science? Is it fair to patients to sell their data? These concerns were addressed in a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2022 that asked Americans for their opinions about the increased presence of AI in their daily lives, and the survey estimated that 37% of Americans were more concerned than excited about such increased presence, with 8% of participants specifically associating their concern with \"people misusing AI\". [ 151 ] Ultimately, the current potential of artificial intelligence in healthcare is additionally hindered by  concerns about mismanagement of data collected, especially in the United States. Automation- beneficence [ edit ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic , or fulfill beneficence . [ 16 ] According to a 2019 study, AI can replace up to 35% of jobs in the UK within the next 10 to 20 years. [ 152 ] However, of these jobs, it was concluded that AI has not eliminated any healthcare jobs so far. Though if AI were to automate healthcare-related jobs, the jobs most susceptible to automation would be those dealing with digital information, radiology, and pathology, as opposed to those dealing with doctor-to-patient interaction. [ 152 ] Ouutputs can be incorrect or incomplete and diagnosis and recommendations harm people. [ 132 ] Bias, discrimination [ edit ] Since AI makes decisions solely on the data it receives as input, it is important that this data represents accurate patient demographics. In a hospital setting, patients do not have full knowledge of how predictive algorithms are created or calibrated. Therefore, these medical establishments can unfairly code their algorithms to discriminate against minorities and prioritize profits rather than providing optimal care, i.e. violating the ethical principle of social justice or non-maleficence . [ 153 ] A recent scoping review identified 18 equity challenges along with 15 strategies that can be implemented to help address them when AI applications are developed using many-to-many mapping. [ 154 ] There can be unintended bias in algorithms that can exacerbate social and healthcare inequities. [ 153 ] Since AI's decisions are a direct reflection of its input data, the data it receives must have accurate representation of patient demographics. For instance, if populations are less represented in healthcare data it is likely to create bias in AI tools that lead to incorrect assumptions of a demographic and impact the ability to provide appropriate care. [ 155 ] White males are overly represented in medical data sets. [ 156 ] Therefore, having minimal patient data on minorities can lead to AI making more accurate predictions for majority populations, leading to unintended worse medical outcomes for minority populations. [ 157 ] Collecting data from minority communities can also lead to medical discrimination. For instance, HIV is a prevalent virus among minority communities and HIV status can be used to discriminate against patients. [ 156 ] In addition to biases that may arise from sample selection, different clinical systems used to collect data may also impact AI functionality. For example, radiographic systems and their outcomes (e.g., resolution) vary by provider. Moreover, clinician work practices, such as the positioning of the patient for radiography, can also greatly influence the data and make comparability difficult. [ 158 ] However, these biases are able to be eliminated through careful implementation and a methodical collection of representative data. A final source of algorithmic bias , which has been called \"label choice bias\", arises when proxy measures are used to train algorithms, that build in bias against certain groups. For example, a widely used algorithm predicted health care costs as a proxy for health care needs, and used predictions to allocate resources to help patients with complex health needs. This introduced bias because Black patients have lower costs, even when they are just as unhealthy as White patients. [ 159 ] Solutions to the \"label choice bias\" aim to match the actual target (what the algorithm is predicting) more closely to the ideal target (what researchers want the algorithm to predict), so for the prior example, instead of predicting cost, researchers would focus on the variable of healthcare needs which is rather more significant. Adjusting the target led to almost double the number of Black patients being selected for the program. History [ edit ] Research in the 1960s and 1970s produced the first problem-solving program, or expert system , known as Dendral . [ 160 ] [ 161 ] While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry, it provided the basis for a subsequent system MYCIN , [ 162 ] considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine. [ 162 ] [ 163 ] MYCIN and other systems such as INTERNIST-1 and CASNET did not achieve routine use by practitioners, however. [ 164 ] The 1980s and 1990s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity. During this time, there was a recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physicians. [ 165 ] Approaches involving fuzzy set theory, [ 166 ] Bayesian networks , [ 167 ] and artificial neural networks , [ 168 ] [ 169 ] have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare. Medical and technological advancements occurring over this half-century period that have enabled the growth of healthcare-related applications of AI to include: Improvements in computing power resulting in faster data collection and data processing [ 170 ] Growth of genomic sequencing databases [ 171 ] Widespread implementation of electronic health record systems [ 172 ] Improvements in natural language processing and computer vision , enabling machines to replicate human perceptual processes [ 173 ] [ 174 ] Enhanced the precision of robot-assisted surgery [ 175 ] Increased tree-based machine learning models that allow flexibility in establishing health predictors [ 176 ] Improvements in deep learning techniques and data logs for rare diseases See also [ edit ] AI alignment Artificial intelligence in mental health Artificial intelligence Glossary of artificial intelligence Full body scanner (i.e. Dermascanner , ...)

While there are only a handful of practical examples for its medical use with enough evidence, hype around the topic is unprecedented 1 . There is a growing list of publications on the subject in the form of academic articles, health policy reports, statements from professional societies, and popular media coverage (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1: Number of medical A.I. studies by year from 2010 to 2020; and by medical specialties. a The number of studies as found on Pubmed.com using the search term)\u201cmachine learning\u201d OR \u201cdeep learning\u201d) and choosing a year in advanced search. b The same search method was used followed by (AND specialty) without specifying a time frame. The number in the circles determine how many studies we found. Full size image A.I. has been used extensively in industries such as transportation, entertainment or IT during the last decade. It has been used to control self-driving vehicles; to trade on the stock market; social media platforms, web browsers and search engines. It is likely that the reader of this paper used some forms of A.I. today for more than an hour by using services such as Google Maps, Waze, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn or Google Search, among a myriad of others. It has potentials in medicine, drug design and healthcare, yet, the proof and evidence are yet to be convincing enough for the general public and the medical community to adopt the technology 2 . The technology is still in its infancy and more studies are published each year than the year before. There are so many papers, conference talks, misleading news headlines and study interpretations that a short and visual guide any medical professional can refer back to in their professional life might be useful. There is no doubt that A.I. will have a beneficial role in healthcare and can penetrate the boundaries of adoption only if medical professionals serve as knowledgeable and supportive guides and leaders in the process 3 . For this, it is critical that physicians understand the basics of the technology so they can see beyond the hype, evaluate A.I.-based studies and clinical validation; as well as acknowledge the limitations and opportunities A.I. has. This paper aims to serve as a short, visual and digestible repository of information and details every physician might need to know in the age of A.I. We describe the simple definition of A.I., its levels, its methods, the differences between the methods with medical examples, the potential benefits, dangers, challenges of A.I., as well as we attempt at providing a futuristic vision about using it in an everyday medical practice. Definition and levels of A.I. A.I. is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer science, psychology, linguistics, and philosophy, among others. According to its simplest definition, artificial intelligence (A.I.) is intelligence demonstrated by machines. It is sometimes also described as \u201cmachines that mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as learning and problem solving\u201d 4 . Nick Bostrom, philosopher at the University of Oxford, described three major levels in the development of A.I. in his book Superintelligence (Fig. 2 5 ). Fig. 2: Levels of A.I. The three levels of A.I. as defined by Nick Bostrom in Superintelligence. The green dot indicates a theoretical threshold for what the ideal scenario would be. Full size image Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) ANI already has incredible pattern recognizing abilities in huge data sets, which makes it perfect for solving text, voice, or image-based classification and clustering problems. It is an algorithm that can excel at a precisely defined, single task. It can play chess like nobody else ever, yet its IQ is zero. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) one day could have a human being\u2019s comprehensive and total cognitive capacity. This is human level A.I. It can reason, argue, memorize and solve issues like you do Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI) theoretically could have humanity\u2019s combined cognitive capacity or even more. Humanity, obviously, would not be able to grasp its knowledge and understand its reasoning. Many organizations work hard to avoid ever reaching this stage. How does A.I. work? A.I. works through a method called machine learning. As there are challenges and tasks so complicated in healthcare that writing traditional algorithms for solving those was not enough anymore, a new method was needed. Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed 6 . If you feed the algorithm with enough data of good quality, machine learning allows them to create strategies for excelling at that particular task. If I want to write a program that can spot cats on photos, I had better turn to machine learning. The reasons why quickly become clear if you try to devise rules that such a program should be based on. How can you spot a cat in a photo? If you devise features you think easily depict cats such as having two ears, two eyes, four legs and such, you find yourself in a situation where you also have to define all these expressions. What is an ear for a program that only \u201csees\u201d pixels on a photo? Therefore, the most efficient way is to feed a machine learning algorithm with images with cats on them, preferably with cats that have been annotated manually by human beings to make sure the images do contain cats. The more such annotated images we feed the algorithm with, the better it will become at recognizing cats on images. It will not understand what a cat is, but it will certainly recognize what we think are cats in photos like we do with an increasing and ruthless efficiency. No matter what task we aim to solve, we feed the simpler machine learning algorithms with data and constantly iterate how it digests it to become better at solving the task. With more complex algorithms such as neural networks and deep learning, it is possible that the algorithm starts creating its own rules and strategies without human input. From there, not even its developers might understand how it draws a conclusion or the strategy it uses to excel at a task. When it comes to technologies we use to make medical decisions, we like to understand the core of the machine or at least the physical/biological explanations behind it. In the case of advanced A.I.-based algorithms, it seems we will not be able to understand more than the theoretical basics. Real-life examples for the subtypes of machine learning Machine learning has many subtypes and combined methods, but we only feature the three major subtypes besides an advanced method, deep learning (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3: Visual guide to machine and deep learning subtypes. a In supervised learning, the teacher (developer) knows what he wants to teach to the child (A.I.), defines the expected answer and the child learns to excel at the task. b In unsupervised learning, the teacher does not influence how the child learns to play but observes the conclusions the child can draw from solving the task. c In reinforcement learning, the teacher knows what he wants to teach to the child but does not define step-by-step how the child should learn it. Instead, the teacher only gives feedback after the task is completed and asks the child to find out his own strategy using those outcomes the teacher rewarded. d In deep learning, it is possible to analyze vastly more complex data sets from images and videos to a sort of human reasoning. It is multi-layered and could mimic how neural networks in the brain work. Full size image Supervised learning Is used when we can precisely define the task we want the algorithm to learn based on data that we already have. Let\u2019s take the following example. We have two sets of medical records of patients, group A and B. In one set, we have family history, lab markers and other details with the diagnosis. In the other set, we have the same kinds of data but without the diagnosis. We would like to build a model that can learn to assign the right diagnosis to patients in group B based on the associations and labels the algorithm learns about in group A. It is like learning with a teacher because we know exactly what the algorithm should learn, and it is by far the most frequently used training mode. Unsupervised learning Is like learning without a teacher. We have a group of patients with different sets of data, but we do not know their individual diagnoses. We build a model, then to try to cluster patients based on similar attributes such as the symptoms they presented with, their lab markers or age and gender. We might learn new associations we have not looked at before. In another example, it can also be useful in clustering tissue samples based on similar gene expression values; or in finding novel drug-drug interactions. In summary, we devise certain rules, let the algorithm learn by itself and we do not modify the algorithm based on the outcome. Reinforcement learning Allows the algorithm to learn how to complete the tasks with a sequence of decisions by itself without being told how to do it. The teacher is only able to give feedback after a series of actions, not for each item as it does with supervised learning. The model starts performing the task only knowing some basic rules, and after failing or succeeding in completing the task, the teacher weighs in to push it to use the winning strategy more. This way, the program can build its own experiences as it performs the task more and more. It is similar to how we train dogs. When the dog performs or tries to perform a task, we only give it a treat if it performed well. The most famous example for this method is how AlphaZero can learn to become the best player in any 2-players game in hours by playing millions of games against itself. It starts playing a game knowing only its basic rules, and the developers let the algorithm know when it won a match to prioritize that strategy while playing the next game 7 . In an example, authors used this method to determine clinical trial dosing, where the algorithm learnt the appropriate dosing regimen to reduce mean tumor diameters in patients undergoing chemo- and radiation therapy 8 . The main challenge with applying reinforcement learning to healthcare is that we cannot play out a large number of scenarios as the lives of patients are at stake. Machine learning vs traditional statistical models A.I. is a huge domain which includes machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, but also methods that do not even process quantitative data. Therefore, it makes sense to compare machine learning to traditional statistical methods. Traditional statistical models focus on discovering relationships and confidence intervals between data points and outcomes. Compared to this, machine learning methods aim to reach high prediction accuracy with putting less emphasis on whether it is possible to interpret the model. The former often analyses a given dataset for its insights, while the latter is trained on a set of data, evaluated on a second set, and then used on an unseen third. Thus, prediction is key in machine learning to generate otherwise unavailable (e.g., expensive or not yet known) data. Also, machine learning is often better suited for large numbers of input variables (think of images with thousands of pixels), while traditional analysis with statistical models was designed for data with tens of input columns 9 . Machine vs deep learning Machine learning is a broad set of methods, their majority were used even decades before the current A.I. revolution. Most breakthroughs are achieved nowadays with artificial neural networks, but there are several other models, each with its own advantages. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and while it has similar functions, its capabilities are different. Deep learning uses a layered structure of artificial neural networks that is inspired by the neural network of the human brain. The internal structure and number of layers within a neural network is a field of active research, but as a rule of thumb we can say that a deeper net with more layers can learn more complex tasks - at the same time requiring more data and longer time to train. Deep models have the capacity to process images, sound and other high dimensionality data with good results, while other machine learning models may perform better with data organized into a spreadsheet. Looking at a medical example, let\u2019s build a model that can cluster patients by diagnosis based on the data in their medical records. If a medical record contains the expression Type 1 Diabetes, a machine learning model will learn to put all such patients in the Type 1 Diabetes cluster. But a deep learning algorithm could learn with time without human input that patients with medical records that only mention T1D should also be assigned to the same group. Programmers of other machine learning algorithms should add these alternatives themselves. Another example might also demonstrate the power and potentials of deep learning. We would like to build a model that turns on the light if we shout the word dark. A deep learning model, by time, would learn that saying \u201cI can\u2019t see\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s dark here\u201d should also turn on the light. How to evaluate news and studies about A.I.? Hardly a day goes by without promising research papers and studies on how to apply machine and deep learning to medical problems. However, as already just mentioning A.I. makes companies\u2019 prospects better on any market, overhyping and overmarketing what an algorithm can do is an everyday phenomenon. There are still ways that help evaluate research papers and news on A.I. There are some general questions we can ask ourselves while reading medical A.I. papers. (Table 1 ) 10 , 11 . Table 1 A summary of some general questions readers of an A.I. medical paper might want to ask themselves to evaluate the quality of the results of a research. Full size table Besides obvious features such as the quality of the journal the paper was published in (real breakthroughs tend to be able to reach the attention of high-level journals), the most important factor is the source of data. It matters where the data stems from, thus it is worth checking the \u2018Methods\u2019 section where authors describe how, where and what kind of data they received. No algorithm can be trained without a good amount of quality data. Moreover, the size of the dataset also matters: the more images, text or any other source materials the researchers have, the more precise the algorithms can become. Collaborations with clinicians and healthcare institutions are crucial in getting large amounts of quality data. If not, some research groups do tricks on their dataset to make it bigger (e.g., rotate images to double the database size). The reported performance (e.g., precision, speed) of the algorithm should be compared to previously existing solutions and human abilities. Even a state-of-the-art technical solution may perform so much worse than human professionals in a real-world clinical setting, that it may not be helpful at all. It is crucial for such technologies to be evaluated whether they can easily be implemented in clinical protocols, and whether the results are straightforward for the medical staff to interpret. It is also key to see whether the paper analyzed a real clinical problem. An algorithm might perform very well on a pre-selected dataset, however, it should also be tested on real clinical data. DeepMind claimed in its published study that its model was able to accurately predict that a patient will develop acute kidney failure \u201cwithin a clinically actionable window\u201d up to 48\u2009h in advance 12 . While the algorithm did do that, it cannot be clinically validated without testing it prospectively in a clinical setting. Also, when you look at the latest pieces of news on smart algorithms, you should watch out for the following to be able to carefully assess the quality of the given A.I.-related article. The term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d itself might be misleading as due to the overuse of the expression, its meaning started to get inflated. If an announcement or news article mentions A.I. without describing the exact method under it, it is a good sign to be skeptical and careful. A company or a research group should mention a subtype of machine or deep learning and be able to explain the method in detail with which they are aiming to create A.I. In a relevant example that took place in Thailand, a Google-backed algorithm aimed at improving care. There, normally, nurses took photos of the eyes of patients during check-ups and shared those to be analyzed by a specialist elsewhere. This process could take up to 10 weeks. The A.I. developed by Google Health identified signs of diabetic retinopathy from an eye scan with an accuracy of more than 90% and provide a result in less than 10\u2009min. When Google started putting this system into practice, they ran into real-life issues. Sometimes a bad internet connection stopped the whole system from working as all images had to be uploaded to the cloud through a strong connection. If the quality of the scan did not meet a certain threshold, it simply did not give a result (the deep learning algorithm has to be fed with high quality images to get better). This way, nurses had to spend time editing some of the images the algorithm chose not to analyze. Developers had to travel to the site to help sort out these issues 13 . As a summary, the medical journal Radiology proposed a guide for authors, reviewers, and readers for assessing radiology research on artificial intelligence 10 . Other medical associations and journal editorial boards might adopt and customize it too. They also describe a checklist that every author should complete when publishing their A.I. research. Examples for how healthcare could benefit from A.I. In short, tasks that are highly repetitive and involve the analysis of quantifiable data might benefit the most from the use of A.I. We feature a few examples that provide a picture about the whole range of opportunities. Improving in-person and online consultations Babylon Health launched an application that offers A.I.-driven consultation. It uses the patient\u2019s medical history and common medical knowledge. Patients report their symptoms through the app which checks those in a database of diseases using speech recognition. After that, it offers a course of action 14 . Health assistance and medication management The medical start-up Sense.ly developed Molly, a virtual nurse that was designed to have a smiling face coupled with a pleasant voice. Its goal is to help assist patients with monitoring their health or disease management in-between doctor\u2019s visits using ML. It also provides customized follow-up care, with a focus on chronic diseases 15 . A similar approach was used by the AiCure app that uses a smartphone\u2019s camera and A.I. to confirm that patients are adhering to their prescriptions 16 . This could be useful for people with serious medical conditions or participants in clinical trials. A.I.-driven diagnostics In 2020, the FDA approved a software programme from the company Caption Health that allows medical professionals to perform cardiac ultrasound imaging without specialized training. It uses A.I. to provide real-time guidance and also the ability to save images of diagnostic quality. It acts as a \u201cco-pilot\u201d for those performing an ultrasound scan as it was designed to emulate the guidance that an expert sonographer would provide to optimize the image. It gives instructions on how to manipulate the transducer, and provides automated feedback on diagnostic image quality 17 . Mining medical records Collecting, storing, normalizing, and tracking medical records is an obvious step for A.I. As an example, Google Deepmind Health is cooperating with the Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust to improve eye treatment by analyzing retina scans. The images are analyzed by DeepMind\u2019s algorithms resulting in a detailed diagnosis and a so-called \u201curgency score\u201d in about 30\u2009s. The prototype system can detect diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration 18 . Precision medicine The company Deep Genomics aims at identifying patterns in genetic data and medical records of patients trying to link mutations to medical conditions. Oncompass Medicine uses A.I.-based algorithms to match genetic mutations found in patients\u2019 tumor samples with ongoing clinical trials worldwide. This way, patients can receive precisely targeted treatments specific to the kind of cancerous tissue they have. Designing treatment plans IBM Watson developed a software that provides evidence-based treatment options for oncologists. It was designed to analyze both structured and unstructured data in medical records that may contribute to decision-making about treatment pathways. The software combines data from the patient\u2019s medical record with clinical expertise, and research papers to suggest promising treatment plans 19 . There are many similar examples in other specialties. Creating an optimized radiation therapy delivery plan usually takes days. A.I.-based technologies help speed this process, completing the process in a couple of minutes 20 , 21 . Drug creation The way pharmaceutical companies develop new drugs through clinical trials can take several years and can cost billions of dollars. Speeding this up while making it more cost-effective would have an enormous effect on healthcare. The company Atomwise uses supercomputers to root out treatments from a database of molecular structures. They also launched a search for a previously unknown combination of safe and existing medicines and in a few days found two drugs predicted by the company\u2019s A.I. technology which may significantly reduce the infectivity of Ebola. Such analysis typically would have taken months or years 22 . Triage tools It is crucial to be able to predict how severe a patient\u2019s medical condition is to support the early identification of those who are vulnerable and at high-risk, especially in emergency medical services. In a study, authors developed and validated an A.I.-based algorithm using deep learning that accurately predicted the need for the critical care of patients and outperformed the conventional triage tools and early warning scores 23 . In another study, authors analyzed online triage tools from more than 150 000 patient interactions with a chatbot, and they found a decreased level of the urgency of patients\u2019 intended level of care in more than one-quarter of the cases 24 . Both studies indicate that A.I.-based technologies can facilitate triaging even before patients reach the point-of-care. How can an A.I.-based medical technology become part of an everyday practice? The success of A.I. and its place in medicine and healthcare highly depend on whether it can penetrate the boundaries of evidence-based medicine, the lack of policies and reluctance from medical professionals to use it. There is no reason to believe that its use will be able to become common practice without meeting the standards and requirements of previous technologies. However, as the demand for A.I. to be implemented into everyday medicine is getting higher by patients, policy makers, medical professionals and hospitals, its way from developers to practice will have to become faster 25 . A typical example of how it has worked so far is related to Kardia, formerly known as AliveCor. They first made an FDA-approved smartphone case that worked as a single lead ECG in 2012. They launched two clinical trials to test the hardware and the app comparing it to a traditional 12-lead device. Later, the evolution of its design resulted in a credit-card sized device and an even smaller version in 2019. The original device could provide a one channel ECG by playing the user\u2019s fingertips on the sensor for 30\u2009s. The results were uploaded to the cloud to make it accessible for physicians. In 2015, Alivecor received clearance by the FDA to use an algorithm for the analysis of the readings to determine issues related to heart rhythm without human help. By the end of 2017, they already used deep learning networks, and the FDA cleared the company\u2019s ECG reader called KardiaBand as a medical device accessory to the Apple Watch. A study concluded that the device managed to distinguish between atrial fibrillation and a normal heart rhythm with a sensitivity of 93, and a specificity of 94%, respectively. Its sensitivity increased to 99% when a medical professional reviewed the reading 26 . By 2020, products of Alivecor have been tested in over 40 clinical studies. Despite these accomplishments, the use of the device is still not common practice. And as other companies producing A.I.-based medical technologies are lagging behind, it might depict a long period of adoption. A.I. will only reach the status of an everyday medical technology if medical associations provide clear guidelines about implementing it; if policy makers create policies that favor adoption; and if the medical community does not look at A.I. as a threat, but rather, as the stethoscope of the 21st century. What are the major challenges ahead? Examples for ANI do exist today, but there are major issues the A.I. developer and the medical community have to face and tackle before A.I. can become mainstream in medicine. Explainability Medical professionals tend to make decisions using data that were obtained with technologies they either understand or understand the basics enough to trust it. In the case of A.I., it might not be possible. However, millions of learned parameters (the connection weights within the network) determine the output of a deep neural network, which makes it unintuitive to understand the decision process. Even if we visualize the sensitivity of different parts of a network and browse these thousands of noisy images, we will still not see easy-to-grasp learned rules. Reasoning is not a by-product of the algorithm. Thus, explainable A.I. would be crucial in providing insights into A.I.-based algorithms enough to gain trust in them. Augmented intelligence This is a term often promoted by organizations such as the American Medical Association. It focuses on A.I.\u2019s assistive role in healthcare emphasizing that A.I.\u2018s design enhances human intelligence rather than replaces it. It also refers to the value an A.I. can provide that comes from how we can combine the unique capabilities of human experts with those of A.I. to provide better care for patients. A similar term that is related to augmented intelligence is \u201chuman-centered A.I.\u201d which explores the need for the development of A.I.-based systems that learn from and collaborate with humans in a deep and meaningful way. Quality and quantity of data A.I. feeds on data. The more and better quality data it gets access to, the more it can excel at tasks. Advanced algorithms need annotated data to make sure those can learn the task they were designed for. There are medical professionals who act as data annotators which is a time-consuming and monotonous task. Some medical algorithms can only improve through large amounts of annotated data. Therefore the dedicated contribution of data annotators is of crucial importance for the benefit of implementing A.I. in the healthcare setting. Therefore, we can conclude that data annotators are the unsung heroes of the medical A.I. revolution 27 . Privacy issues Medical A.I. needs access to medical records, data from health sensors, medical algorithms, apps and whatever source of information it can learn from. The data can come from healthcare institutions or from individuals. Even if institutions make data anonymized, it was proven in many cases that individual profiles can be traced back. Legal issues and liability What if a deep learning algorithm misses a diagnosis, the doctor accepts the judgment and the patient suffers from the consequences? What if an autonomous surgical robot injures a patient during a procedure? It is an ongoing debate about who will be held liable in the future when robots and A.I., acting autonomously, harm patients. Current consensus states that the professional is open to liability if he or she used the tool in a situation outside the scope of its regulatory approval, or misused it, or applied it despite significant professional doubts of the validity of the evidence surrounding the tool, or with knowledge of the toolmaker obfuscating negative facts. In any other cases, liability falls back on the creators and the companies behind them. Trust We will need a lot of time to trust an autonomous car, to see how it reacts in situations we are familiar with or whether it makes similar decisions in an emergency. Consequently, it will take even more time not only for patients but for medical professionals too to trust A.I. with medical diagnoses, supporting medical decision-making or designing new drugs. This should be taken into consideration when we decide to adopt the technology into the healthcare setting. Biased A.I. A study concluded that commercial companies\u2019 facial-recognition systems were more accurate on lighter-skinned individuals by 11\u201319%. Those produced especially inaccurate results when identifying women of color. In another example, A.I. was implemented in the United States\u2019 criminal justice system in order to predict recidivism. They found that the algorithm predicted disproportionately high probability of black people committing future crimes, no matter how minor their initial offense was. It is not only racial prejudice, but A.I. algorithms also often discriminate against women, minorities, other cultures, or ideologies. For example, Amazon\u2019s HR department had to stop using their A.I.-based machine learning tool which the company developed for sorting out the best job applicants, as it turned out that the smart algorithm favored men. As such algorithms learn from the data they are fed with, A.I. programmers must know about the issue of bias in algorithms and actively fight against it by tailoring them 28 . Patient design When designing algorithms for medical purposes, patients should be involved on the highest level of decision making to make sure their needs are met, and issues and recommendations are built into the technology. An example about its importance is how a start-up developed an algorithm that could detect signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in phone calls of patients in Canada. However, it showed different results with patients who had a French accent. By inviting patients at the early stages of development, such issues could be avoided. As there are positive ongoing efforts for solving each of these, it is still an open question whether those algorithms that become a common part of medical practices would be able to address them all 29 . The future role of A.I. in medicine and healthcar e Every A.I.-based technology that is considered for use in healthcare must be regulated, efficient and backed by evidence 30 . The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been showing an example in achieving a regulatory environment that not only welcomes such innovations but is also able to keep them safe for the public. The FDA launched a branch for digital health in 2019 and has attempted at designing new regulatory standards for A.I.-based technologies. The FDA realized that in the era of A.I., more algorithms will become available than medical devices as there is a shift from hardware to software. As the number of algorithms to be regulated grows exponentially, the current resources of regulatory bodies will not be sufficient for assessing each iteration and update. There have been discussions around a new regulatory framework for modifications to A.I./machine learning-based software as a medical device (SaMD) 31 . This could potentially lead to regulations that make it possible for regulators to assess companies while the companies can roll out algorithms and updates without the need to check them all. This is a viable way of letting A.I.-based technologies become widespread while keeping them safe. Our research group has attempted at creating a constantly updated database of FDA-approved A.I.-based medical technologies. After cross-checking and validating every approval we could find, we identified 64 A.I.-based and, at the same time, FDA approved medical technologies. Only 29 of those (45%) mentioned any A.I.-related terms or expressions in the announcement released by the FDA. Such technologies can only be efficient if they are successfully implemented into the medical practice. The American Medical Association (AMA) has addressed the importance of A.I., has advocated for the use of the expression augmented intelligence, and has assumed thought leadership with its reports and guidelines for physicians. In their AI policy, they state that \u201cas a leader in American medicine, our AMA has a unique opportunity to ensure that the evolution of AI in medicine benefits patients, physicians and the health care community\u201d 32 . To make sure that A.I.-based technologies meet the standards of evidence-based medicine, numerous editorial boards of medical journals and prestigious medical associations such as the WHO or CDC have released their recommendations for the medical community 33 , 34 . One of the potential obstacles in adoption can be a common fear among medical professionals that A.I. will replace them. While highly repetitive and data-based professions, or rather tasks under those professions will probably be highly impacted by automation, the core of the medical profession is and still will be the human touch, empathy and compassionate care; attributes that are almost impossible to mimic through a programming language. However, as a general rule of thumb, we might be able to assume that those medical professionals who use A.I. will replace those who do not do so. That is how such a profound role A.I. will have in the future of medicine. The debate early in the 21st century should not be about whether A.I. takes away the human touch or the art of medicine, but what we should do to improve both with it. When an algorithm using reinforcement learning, thus not being restricted by our human cognitive limitations, comes up with a cure which we could never find with our knowledge about biology, medicine and other life science, the real art of medicine will be to find out and to understand how it did that 35 . With this basic knowledge about the definition, levels, methods, challenges and potentials of A.I., we tried to give an overview about how we can make the medical profession more creative, spending more time with patients than ever.

In this review article, we outline recent breakthroughs in the application of AI in healthcare, describe a roadmap to building effective, reliable and safe AI systems, and discuss the possible future direction of AI augmented healthcare systems. KEYWORDS: AI, digital health Introduction Healthcare systems around the world face significant challenges in achieving the \u2018quadruple aim\u2019 for healthcare: improve population health, improve the patient's experience of care, enhance caregiver experience and reduce the rising cost of care. 1\u20133 Ageing populations, growing burden of chronic diseases and rising costs of healthcare globally are challenging governments, payers, regulators and providers to innovate and transform models of healthcare delivery. Moreover, against a backdrop now catalysed by the global pandemic, healthcare systems find themselves challenged to \u2018perform\u2019 (deliver effective, high-quality care) and \u2018transform\u2019 care at scale by leveraging real-world data driven insights directly into patient care. The pandemic has also highlighted the shortages in healthcare workforce and inequities in the access to care, previously articulated by The King's Fund and the World Health Organization (Box 1 ). 4,5 Box 1. Workforce challenges in the next decade By 2030, the gap between supply of and demand for staff employed by NHS trusts could increase to almost 250,000 full-time equivalent posts. 4 Based on the current trends and needs of the global population by 2030, the world will have 18 million fewer healthcare professionals (especially marked differences in the developing world), including 5 million fewer doctors than society will require. 5 Open in a new tab The application of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has the potential to address some of these supply-and-demand challenges. The increasing availability of multi-modal data (genomics, economic, demographic, clinical and phenotypic) coupled with technology innovations in mobile, internet of things (IoT), computing power and data security herald a moment of convergence between healthcare and technology to fundamentally transform models of healthcare delivery through AI-augmented healthcare systems. In particular, cloud computing is enabling the transition of effective and safe AI systems into mainstream healthcare delivery. Cloud computing is providing the computing capacity for the analysis of considerably large amounts of data, at higher speeds and lower costs compared with historic \u2018on premises\u2019 infrastructure of healthcare organisations. Indeed, we observe that many technology providers are increasingly seeking to partner with healthcare organisations to drive AI-driven medical innovation enabled by cloud computing and technology-related transformation (Box 2 ). 6\u20138 Box 2. Quotes from technology leaders Satya Nadella, chief executive officer, Microsoft: \u2018AI is perhaps the most transformational technology of our time, and healthcare is perhaps AI's most pressing application.\u2019 6 Tim Cook, chief executive officer, Apple: \u2018[Healthcare] is a business opportunity ... if you look at it, medical health activity is the largest or second-largest component of the economy.\u2019 7 Google Health: \u2018We think that AI is poised to transform medicine, delivering new, assistive technologies that will empower doctors to better serve their patients. Machine learning has dozens of possible application areas, but healthcare stands out as a remarkable opportunity to benefit people.\u2019 8 Open in a new tab Here, we summarise recent breakthroughs in the application of AI in healthcare, describe a roadmap to building effective AI systems and discuss the possible future direction of AI augmented healthcare systems. What is artificial intelligence? Simply put, AI refers to the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, through algorithms or a set of rules, which the machine follows to mimic human cognitive functions, such as learning and problem solving. 9 AI systems have the potential to anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up and, as such, operate in an intentional, intelligent and adaptive manner. 10 AI's strength is in its ability to learn and recognise patterns and relationships from large multidimensional and multimodal datasets; for example, AI systems could translate a patient's entire medical record into a single number that represents a likely diagnosis. 11,12 Moreover, AI systems are dynamic and autonomous, learning and adapting as more data become available. 13 AI is not one ubiquitous, universal technology, rather, it represents several subfields (such as machine learning and deep learning) that, individually or in combination, add intelligence to applications. Machine learning (ML) refers to the study of algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience. 14 ML itself may be categorised as \u2018supervised\u2019, \u2018unsupervised\u2019 and \u2018reinforcement learning\u2019 (RL), and there is ongoing research in various sub-fields including \u2018semi-supervised\u2019, \u2018self-supervised\u2019 and \u2018multi-instance\u2019 ML. Supervised learning leverages labelled data (annotated information); for example, using labelled X-ray images of known tumours to detect tumours in new images. 15 \u2018Unsupervised learning\u2019 attempts to extract information from data without labels; for example, categorising groups of patients with similar symptoms to identify a common cause. 16 In RL, computational agents learn by trial and error, or by expert demonstration. The algorithm learns by developing a strategy to maximise rewards. Of note, major breakthroughs in AI in recent years have been based on RL. Deep learning (DL) is a class of algorithms that learns by using a large, many-layered collection of connected processes and exposing these processors to a vast set of examples. DL has emerged as the predominant method in AI today driving improvements in areas such as image and speech recognition. 17,18 How to build effective and trusted AI-augmented healthcare systems? Despite more than a decade of significant focus, the use and adoption of AI in clinical practice remains limited, with many AI products for healthcare still at the design and develop stage. 19\u201322 While there are different ways to build AI systems for healthcare, far too often there are attempts to force square pegs into round holes ie find healthcare problems to apply AI solutions to without due consideration to local context (such as clinical workflows, user needs, trust, safety and ethical implications). We hold the view that AI amplifies and augments, rather than replaces, human intelligence. Hence, when building AI systems in healthcare, it is key to not replace the important elements of the human interaction in medicine but to focus it, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of that interaction. Moreover, AI innovations in healthcare will come through an in-depth, human-centred understanding of the complexity of patient journeys and care pathways. In Fig 1 , we describe a problem-driven, human-centred approach, adapted from frameworks by Wiens et al , Care and Sendak to building effective and reliable AI-augmented healthcare systems. 23\u201325 Fig 1. Open in a new tab Multi-step, iterative approach to build effective and reliable AI-augmented systems in healthcare. Design and develop The first stage is to design and develop AI solutions for the right problems using a human-centred AI and experimentation approach and engaging appropriate stakeholders, especially the healthcare users themselves. Stakeholder engagement and co-creation Build a multidisciplinary team including computer and social scientists, operational and research leadership, and clinical stakeholders (physician, caregivers and patients) and subject experts (eg for biomedical scientists) that would include authorisers, motivators, financiers, conveners, connectors, implementers and champions. 26 A multi-stakeholder team brings the technical, strategic, operational expertise to define problems, goals, success metrics and intermediate milestones. Human-centred AI A human-centred AI approach combines an ethnographic understanding of health systems, with AI. Through user-designed research, first understand the key problems (we suggest using a qualitative study design to understand \u2018what is the problem\u2019, \u2018why is it a problem\u2019, \u2018to whom does it matter\u2019, \u2018why has it not been addressed before\u2019 and \u2018why is it not getting attention\u2019) including the needs, constraints and workflows in healthcare organisations, and the facilitators and barriers to the integration of AI within the clinical context. After defining key problems, the next step is to identify which problems are appropriate for AI to solve, whether there is availability of applicable datasets to build and later evaluate AI. By contextualising algorithms in an existing workflow, AI systems would operate within existing norms and practices to ensure adoption, providing appropriate solutions to existing problems for the end user. Experimentation The focus should be on piloting of new stepwise experiments to build AI tools, using tight feedback loops from stakeholders to facilitate rapid experiential learning and incremental changes. 27 The experiments would allow the trying out of new ideas simultaneously, exploring to see which one works, learn what works and what doesn't, and why. 28 Experimentation and feedback will help to elucidate the purpose and intended uses for the AI system: the likely end users and the potential harm and ethical implications of AI system to them (for instance, data privacy, security, equity and safety). Evaluate and validate Next, we must iteratively evaluate and validate the predictions made by the AI tool to test how well it is functioning. This is critical, and evaluation is based on three dimensions: statistical validity, clinical utility and economic utility. Statistical validity is understanding the performance of AI on metrics of accuracy, reliability, robustness, stability and calibration. High model performance on retrospective, in silico settings is not sufficient to demonstrate clinical utility or impact. To determine clinical utility, evaluate the algorithm in a real-time environment on a hold-out and temporal validation set (eg longitudinal and external geographic datasets) to demonstrate clinical effectiveness and generalisability. 25 Economic utility quantifies the net benefit relative to the cost from the investment in the AI system. Scale and diffuse Many AI systems are initially designed to solve a problem at one healthcare system based on the patient population specific to that location and context. Scale up of AI systems requires special attention to deployment modalities, model updates, the regulatory system, variation between systems and reimbursement environment. Monitor and maintain Even after an AI system has been deployed clinically, it must be continually monitored and maintained to monitor for risks and adverse events using effective post-market surveillance. Healthcare organisations, regulatory bodies and AI developers should cooperate to collate and analyse the relevant datasets for AI performance, clinical and safety-related risks, and adverse events. 29 What are the current and future use cases of AI in healthcare? AI can enable healthcare systems to achieve their \u2018quadruple aim\u2019 by democratising and standardising a future of connected and AI augmented care, precision diagnostics, precision therapeutics and, ultimately, precision medicine (Table 1 ). 30 Research in the application of AI healthcare continues to accelerate rapidly, with potential use cases being demonstrated across the healthcare sector (both physical and mental health) including drug discovery, virtual clinical consultation, disease diagnosis, prognosis, medication management and health monitoring. Table 1. Widescale adoption and application of artificial intelligence in healthcare Timeline Connected/augmented care Precision diagnostics Precision therapeutics Precision Medicine Summary Short term: 0\u20135 years Internet of things in healthcare Virtual assistants Augmented telehealth Personalised mental health support Precision imaging (eg diabetic retinopathy and radiotherapy planning) CRISPR (increasing use) Digital and AI enabled research hospitals 30 AI automates time consuming, high-volume repetitive tasks, especially within precision imaging Medium-term: 5\u201310 years Ambient intelligence in healthcare Large-scale adoption and scale-up of precision imaging Synthetic biology Immunomics Customisation of healthcare Robotic assisted therapies AI uses multi-modal datasets to drive precision therapeutics Long term: >10 years Autonomous virtual health assistants, delivering predictive and anticipatory care Networked and connected care organisations (single digital infrastructure) Holographic and hybrid imaging Holomics (integrated genomic/radiomic/proteomic/clinical/immunohistochemical data) Genomics medicine AI driven drug discovery New curative treatments AI empowered healthcare professionals (eg digital twins) AI enables healthcare systems to achieve a state of precision medicine through AI-augmented healthcare and connected care Open in a new tab Timings are illustrative to widescale adoption of the proposed innovation taking into account challenges / regulatory environment / use at scale. We describe a non-exhaustive suite of AI applications in healthcare in the near term, medium term and longer term, for the potential capabilities of AI to augment, automate and transform medicine. AI today (and in the near future) Currently, AI systems are not reasoning engines ie cannot reason the same way as human physicians, who can draw upon \u2018common sense\u2019 or \u2018clinical intuition and experience\u2019. 12 Instead, AI resembles a signal translator, translating patterns from datasets. AI systems today are beginning to be adopted by healthcare organisations to automate time consuming, high volume repetitive tasks. Moreover, there is considerable progress in demonstrating the use of AI in precision diagnostics (eg diabetic retinopathy and radiotherapy planning). AI in the medium term (the next 5\u201310 years) In the medium term, we propose that there will be significant progress in the development of powerful algorithms that are efficient (eg require less data to train), able to use unlabelled data, and can combine disparate structured and unstructured data including imaging, electronic health data, multi-omic, behavioural and pharmacological data. In addition, healthcare organisations and medical practices will evolve from being adopters of AI platforms, to becoming co-innovators with technology partners in the development of novel AI systems for precision therapeutics. AI in the long term (>10 years) In the long term, AI systems will become more intelligent , enabling AI healthcare systems achieve a state of precision medicine through AI-augmented healthcare and connected care. Healthcare will shift from the traditional one-size-fits-all form of medicine to a preventative, personalised, data-driven disease management model that achieves improved patient outcomes (improved patient and clinical experiences of care) in a more cost-effective delivery system. Connected/augmented care AI could significantly reduce inefficiency in healthcare, improve patient flow and experience, and enhance caregiver experience and patient safety through the care pathway; for example, AI could be applied to the remote monitoring of patients (eg intelligent telehealth through wearables/sensors) to identify and provide timely care of patients at risk of deterioration. In the long term, we expect that healthcare clinics, hospitals, social care services, patients and caregivers to be all connected to a single, interoperable digital infrastructure using passive sensors in combination with ambient intelligence. 31 Following are two AI applications in connected care. Virtual assistants and AI chatbots AI chatbots (such as those used in Babylon ( www.babylonhealth.com ) and Ada ( https://ada.com )) are being used by patients to identify symptoms and recommend further actions in community and primary care settings. AI chatbots can be integrated with wearable devices such as smartwatches to provide insights to both patients and caregivers in improving their behaviour, sleep and general wellness. Ambient and intelligent care We also note the emergence of ambient sensing without the need for any peripherals. Emerald ( www.emeraldinno.com ): a wireless, touchless sensor and machine learning platform for remote monitoring of sleep, breathing and behaviour, founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and researchers. Google nest: claiming to monitor sleep (including sleep disturbances like cough) using motion and sound sensors. 32 A recently published article exploring the ability to use smart speakers to contactlessly monitor heart rhythms. 33 Automation and ambient clinical intelligence: AI systems leveraging natural language processing (NLP) technology have the potential to automate administrative tasks such as documenting patient visits in electronic health records, optimising clinical workflow and enabling clinicians to focus more time on caring for patients (eg Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience ( www.nuance.com/healthcare/ambient-clinical-intelligence.html )). Precision diagnostics Diagnostic imaging The automated classification of medical images is the leading AI application today. A recent review of AI/ML-based medical devices approved in the USA and Europe from 2015\u20132020 found that more than half (129 (58%) devices in the USA and 126 (53%) devices in Europe) were approved or CE marked for radiological use. 34 Studies have demonstrated AI's ability to meet or exceed the performance of human experts in image-based diagnoses from several medical specialties including pneumonia in radiology (a convolutional neural network trained with labelled frontal chest X-ray images outperformed radiologists in detecting pneumonia), dermatology (a convolutional neural network was trained with clinical images and was found to classify skin lesions accurately), pathology (one study trained AI algorithms with whole-slide pathology images to detect lymph node metastases of breast cancer and compared the results with those of pathologists) and cardiology (a deep learning algorithm diagnosed heart attack with a performance comparable with that of cardiologists). 35\u201338 We recognise that there are some exemplars in this area in the NHS (eg University of Leeds Virtual Pathology Project and the National Pathology Imaging Co-operative) and expect widescale adoption and scaleup of AI-based diagnostic imaging in the medium term. 39 We provide two use cases of such technologies. Diabetic retinopathy screening Key to reducing preventable, diabetes-related vision loss worldwide is screening individuals for detection and the prompt treatment of diabetic retinopathy. However, screening is costly given the substantial number of diabetes patients and limited manpower for eye care worldwide. 40 Research studies on automated AI algorithms for diabetic retinopathy in the USA, Singapore, Thailand and India have demonstrated robust diagnostic performance and cost effectiveness. 41\u201344 Moreover, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved Medicare reimbursement for the use of Food and Drug Administration approved AI algorithm \u2018IDx-DR\u2019, which demonstrated 87% sensitivity and 90% specificity for detecting more-than-mild diabetic retinopathy. 45 Improving the precision and reducing waiting timings for radiotherapy planning An important AI application is to assist clinicians for image preparation and planning tasks for radiotherapy cancer treatment. Currently, segmentation of the images is time consuming and laborious task, performed manually by an oncologist using specially designed software to draw contours around the regions of interest. The AI-based InnerEye open-source technology can cut this preparation time for head and neck, and prostate cancer by up to 90%, meaning that waiting times for starting potentially life-saving radiotherapy treatment can be dramatically reduced (Fig 2 ). 46,47 Fig 2. Open in a new tab Potential applications for the InnerEye deep learning toolkit include quantitative radiology for monitoring tumour progression, planning for surgery and radiotherapy planning. 47 Precision therapeutics To make progress towards precision therapeutics, we need to considerably improve our understanding of disease. Researchers globally are exploring the cellular and molecular basis of disease, collecting a range of multimodal datasets that can lead to digital and biological biomarkers for diagnosis, severity and progression. Two important future AI applications include immunomics / synthetic biology and drug discovery. Immunomics and synthetic biology Through the application of AI tools on multimodal datasets in the future, we may be able to better understand the cellular basis of disease and the clustering of diseases and patient populations to provide more targeted preventive strategies, for example, using immunomics to diagnose and better predict care and treatment options. This will be revolutionary for multiple standards of care, with particular impact in the cancer, neurological and rare disease space, personalising the experience of care for the individual. AI-driven drug discovery AI will drive significant improvement in clinical trial design and optimisation of drug manufacturing processes, and, in general, any combinatorial optimisation process in healthcare could be replaced by AI. We have already seen the beginnings of this with the recent announcements by DeepMind and AlphaFold, which now sets the stage for better understanding disease processes, predicting protein structures and developing more targeted therapeutics (for both rare and more common diseases; Fig 3 ). 48,49 Fig 3. Open in a new tab An overview of the main neural network model architecture for AlphaFold. 49 MSA = multiple sequence alignment. Precision medicine New curative therapies Over the past decade, synthetic biology has produced developments like CRISPR gene editing and some personalised cancer therapies. However, the life cycle for developing such advanced therapies is still extremely inefficient and expensive. In future, with better access to data (genomic, proteomic, glycomic, metabolomic and bioinformatic), AI will allow us to handle far more systematic complexity and, in turn, help us transform the way we understand, discover and affect biology. This will improve the efficiency of the drug discovery process by helping better predict early which agents are more likely to be effective and also better anticipate adverse drug effects, which have often thwarted the further development of otherwise effective drugs at a costly late stage in the development process. This, in turn will democratise access to novel advanced therapies at a lower cost. AI empowered healthcare professionals In the longer term, healthcare professionals will leverage AI in augmenting the care they provide, allowing them to provide safer, standardised and more effective care at the top of their licence; for example, clinicians could use an \u2018AI digital consult\u2019 to examine \u2018digital twin\u2019 models of their patients (a truly \u2018digital and biomedical\u2019 version of a patient), allowing them to \u2018test\u2019 the effectiveness, safety and experience of an intervention (such as a cancer drug) in the digital environment prior to delivering the intervention to the patient in the real world. Challenges We recognise that there are significant challenges related to the wider adoption and deployment of AI into healthcare systems. These challenges include, but are not limited to, data quality and access, technical infrastructure, organisational capacity, and ethical and responsible practices in addition to aspects related to safety and regulation. Some of these issues have been covered, but others go beyond the scope of this current article. Conclusion and key recommendations Advances in AI have the potential to transform many aspects of healthcare, enabling a future that is more personalised, precise, predictive and portable. It is unclear if we will see an incremental adoption of new technologies or radical adoption of these technological innovations, but the impact of such technologies and the digital renaissance they bring requires health systems to consider how best they will adapt to the changing landscape. For the NHS, the application of such technologies truly has the potential to release time for care back to healthcare professionals, enabling them to focus on what matters to their patients and, in the future, leveraging a globally democratised set of data assets comprising the \u2018highest levels of human knowledge\u2019 to \u2018work at the limits of science\u2019 to deliver a common high standard of care, wherever and whenever it is delivered, and by whoever. 50 Globally, AI could become a key tool for improving health equity around the world. As much as the last 10 years have been about the roll out of digitisation of health records for the purposes of efficiency (and in some healthcare systems, billing/reimbursement), the next 10 years will be about the insight and value society can gain from these digital assets, and how these can be translated into driving better clinical outcomes with the assistance of AI, and the subsequent creation of novel data assets and tools. It is clear that we are at an turning point as it relates to the convergence of the practice of medicine and the application of technology, and although there are multiple opportunities, there are formidable challenges that need to be overcome as it relates to the real world and the scale of implementation of such innovation. A key to delivering this vision will be an expansion of translational research in the field of healthcare applications of artificial intelligence. Alongside this, we need investment into the upskilling of a healthcare workforce and future leaders that are digitally enabled, and to understand and embrace, rather than being intimidated by, the potential of an AI-augmented healthcare system. Healthcare leaders should consider (as a minimum) these issues when planning to leverage AI for health: processes for ethical and responsible access to data: healthcare data is highly sensitive, inconsistent, siloed and not optimised for the purposes of machine learning development, evaluation, implementation and adoption access to domain expertise / prior knowledge to make sense and create some of the rules which need to be applied to the datasets (to generate the necessary insight) access to sufficient computing power to generate decisions in real time, which is being transformed exponentially with the advent of cloud computing research into implementation: critically, we must consider, explore and research issues which arise when you take the algorithm and put it in the real world, building \u2018trusted\u2019 AI algorithms embedded into appropriate workflows.

In some cases, it can exceed or augment human capabilities by providing better or faster ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] As the widespread use of AI in healthcare is still relatively new, research is ongoing into its applications across various medical subdisciplines and related industries. AI programs are being applied to practices such as diagnostics , [ 4 ] treatment protocol development, [ 5 ] drug development , [ 6 ] personalized medicine , [ 7 ] and patient monitoring and care. [ 8 ] Since radiographs are the most commonly performed imaging tests in radiology, the potential for AI to assist with triage and interpretation of radiographs is particularly significant. [ 9 ] Using AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy , automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases . [ 10 ] Furthermore, new technologies such as AI are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption. [ 11 ] In contrast, there are also several cases where AI has been put to use in healthcare without proper testing. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic. [ 16 ] Moreover, meta-studies have found that the scientific literature on AI in healthcare often suffers from a lack of reproducibility . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Applications in healthcare systems [ edit ] Disease diagnosis [ edit ] Accurate and early diagnosis of diseases is still a challenge in healthcare. Recognizing medical conditions and their symptoms is a complex problem. AI can assist clinicians with its data processing capabilities to save time and improve accuracy. [ 21 ] Through the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence can be able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the analysis of mass electronic health records (EHRs). [ 22 ] AI can help early prediction, for example, of Alzheimer's disease and dementias , by looking through large numbers of similar cases and possible treatments. [ 23 ] AI can aid doctors' decision-making in emergency cases, for example, in emergency departments. AI algorithms may assist in prioritizing critical cases, cutting down waiting times. Also, AI-backed decision support systems make recommendations instantly and enable quicker interpretation of data, which supports healthcare professionals' decisions. [ 21 ] In 2023 a study reported higher satisfaction rates with ChatGPT -generated responses compared with those from physicians for medical questions posted on Reddit \u2019s r/AskDocs. [ 24 ] Evaluators preferred ChatGPT's responses to physician responses in 78.6% of 585 evaluations, noting better quality and empathy. The authors noted that these were isolated questions taken from an online forum, not in the context of an established patient-physician relationship. [ 24 ] Moreover, responses were not graded on the accuracy of medical information, and some have argued that the experiment was not properly blinded , with the evaluators being coauthors of the study. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Recent developments in statistical physics , machine learning , and inference algorithms are also being explored for their potential in improving medical diagnostic approaches. [ 28 ] Also, the establishment of large healthcare-related data warehouses of sometimes hundreds of millions of patients provides extensive training data for AI models. [ 29 ] Electronic health records [ edit ] Electronic health records (EHR) are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. Now that around 80% of medical practices use EHR, some anticipate the use of artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians. [ 30 ] One application uses natural language processing (NLP) to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms. [ 30 ] For example, the term heart attack and myocardial infarction mean the same things, but physicians may use one over the other based on personal preferences. [ 30 ] NLP algorithms consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed. [ 30 ] Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician's notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read. [ 30 ] Other applications use concept processing to analyze the information entered by the current patient's doctor to present similar cases and help the physician remember to include all relevant details. [ 31 ] Beyond making content edits to an EHR, there are AI algorithms that evaluate an individual patient's record and predict a risk for a disease based on their previous information and family history. [ 32 ] One general algorithm is a rule-based system that makes decisions similarly to how humans use flow charts. [ 33 ] This system takes in large amounts of data and creates a set of rules that connect specific observations to concluded diagnoses. [ 33 ] Thus, the algorithm can take in a new patient's data and try to predict the likeliness that they will have a certain condition or disease. [ 33 ] Since the algorithms can evaluate a patient's information based on collective data, they can find any outstanding issues to bring to a physician's attention and save time. [ 32 ] One study conducted by the Centerstone research institute found that predictive modeling of EHR data has achieved 70\u201372% accuracy in predicting individualized treatment response. [ 34 ] These methods are helpful due to the fact that the amount of online health records doubles every five years. [ 32 ] Physicians do not have the bandwidth to process all this data manually, and AI can leverage this data to assist physicians in treating their patients. [ 32 ] Drug interactions [ edit ] Improvements in natural language processing led to the development of algorithms to identify drug-drug interactions in medical literature. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Drug-drug interactions pose a threat to those taking multiple medications simultaneously, and the danger increases with the number of medications being taken. [ 39 ] To address the difficulty of tracking all known or suspected drug-drug interactions, machine learning algorithms have been created to extract information on interacting drugs and their possible effects from medical literature. Efforts were consolidated in 2013 in the DDIExtraction Challenge, in which a team of researchers at Carlos III University assembled a corpus of literature on drug-drug interactions to form a standardized test for such algorithms. [ 40 ] Competitors were tested on their ability to accurately determine, from the text, which drugs were shown to interact and what the characteristics of their interactions were. [ 41 ] Researchers continue to use this corpus to standardize the measurement of the effectiveness of their algorithms. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 38 ] Other algorithms identify drug-drug interactions from patterns in user-generated content , especially electronic health records and/or adverse event reports. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Organizations such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the World Health Organization's VigiBase allow doctors to submit reports of possible negative reactions to medications. Deep learning algorithms have been developed to parse these reports and detect patterns that imply drug-drug interactions. [ 42 ] Telemedicine [ edit ] An elderly man using a pulse oximeter to measure his blood oxygen levels The increase of telemedicine , the treatment of patients remotely, has shown the rise of possible AI applications. [ 43 ] AI can assist in caring for patients remotely by monitoring their information through sensors. [ 44 ] A wearable device may allow for constant monitoring of a patient and the ability to notice changes that may be less distinguishable by humans. The information can be compared to other data that has already been collected using artificial intelligence algorithms that alert physicians if there are any issues to be aware of. [ 44 ] Another application of artificial intelligence is chat-bot therapy. Some researchers charge that the reliance on chatbots for mental healthcare does not offer the reciprocity and accountability of care that should exist in the relationship between the consumer of mental healthcare and the care provider (be it a chat-bot or psychologist), though. [ 45 ] Some examples of these chatbots include Woebot, Earkick and Wysa. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Since the average age has risen due to a longer life expectancy, artificial intelligence could be useful in helping take care of older populations. [ 49 ] Tools such as environment and personal sensors can identify a person's regular activities and alert a caretaker if a behavior or a measured vital is abnormal. [ 49 ] Although the technology is useful, there are also discussions about limitations of monitoring in order to respect a person's privacy since there are technologies that are designed to map out home layouts and detect human interactions. [ 49 ] Workload management [ edit ] AI has the potential to streamline care coordination and reduce the workload. AI algorithms can automate administrative tasks, prioritize patient needs and facilitate seamless communication in a healthcare team. [ 50 ] This enables healthcare providers to focus more on direct patient care and ensures the efficient and coordinated delivery of healthcare services. Clinical applications [ edit ] Cardiovascular [ edit ] Artificial intelligence algorithms have shown promising results in accurately diagnosing and risk stratifying patients with concern for coronary artery disease, showing potential as an initial triage tool. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Other algorithms have been used in predicting patient mortality, medication effects, and adverse events following treatment for acute coronary syndrome . [ 51 ] Wearables, smartphones, and internet-based technologies have also shown the ability to monitor patients' cardiac data points, expanding the amount of data and the various settings AI models can use and potentially enabling earlier detection of cardiac events occurring outside of the hospital. [ 53 ] A research in 2019 found that AI can be used to predict heart attack with up to 90% accuracy. [ 54 ] Another growing area of research is the utility of AI in classifying heart sounds and diagnosing valvular disease . [ 55 ] Challenges of AI in cardiovascular medicine have included the limited data available to train machine learning models, such as limited data on social determinants of health as they pertain to cardiovascular disease . [ 56 ] A key limitation in early studies evaluating AI were omissions of data comparing algorithmic performance to humans. Examples of studies which assess AI performance relative to physicians includes how AI is non-inferior to humans in interpretation of cardiac echocardiograms [ 57 ] and that AI can diagnose heart attack better than human physicians in the emergency setting, reducing both low-value testing and missed diagnoses. [ 58 ] In cardiovascular tissue engineering and organoid studies, AI is increasingly used to analyze microscopy images, and integrate electrophysiological read outs. [ 59 ] Dermatology [ edit ] Medical imaging (such as X-ray and photography) is a commonly used tool in dermatology [ 60 ] and the development of deep learning has been strongly tied to image\u00a0processing . Therefore, there is a natural fit between the dermatology and deep learning. Machine learning learning holds great potential to process these images for better diagnoses. [ 61 ] Han et al. showed keratinocytic skin cancer detection from face photographs. [ 62 ] Esteva et al. demonstrated dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer from lesion images. [ 63 ] Noyan et al. demonstrated a convolutional neural network that achieved 94% accuracy at identifying skin cells from microscopic Tzanck smear images. [ 64 ] A concern raised with this work is that it has not engaged with disparities related to skin color or differential treatment of patients with non-white skin tones. [ 65 ] According to some researchers, AI algorithms have been shown to be more effective than dermatologists at identifying cancer. [ 66 ] However, a 2021 review article found that a majority of papers analyzing the performance of AI algorithms designed for skin cancer classification failed to use external test sets. [ 67 ] Only four research studies were found in which the AI algorithms were tested on clinics, regions, or populations distinct from those it was trained on, and in each of those four studies, the performance of dermatologists was found to be on par with that of the algorithm. Moreover, only one study [ 68 ] was set in the context of a full clinical examination; others were based on interaction through web-apps or online questionnaires, with most based entirely on context-free images of lesions. In this study, it was found that dermatologists significantly outperformed the algorithms. Many articles claiming superior performance of AI algorithms also fail to distinguish between trainees and board-certified dermatologists in their analyses. [ 67 ] It has also been suggested that AI could be used to automatically evaluate the outcome of maxillo-facial surgery or cleft palate therapy in regard to facial attractiveness or age appearance. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Gastroenterology [ edit ] AI can play a role in various facets of the field of gastroenterology . Endoscopic exams such as esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD) and colonoscopies rely on rapid detection of abnormal tissue. By enhancing these endoscopic procedures with AI, clinicians can more rapidly identify diseases, determine their severity, and visualize blind spots. Early trials in using AI detection systems of early stomach cancer have shown sensitivity close to expert endoscopists. [ 71 ] AI can assist doctors treating ulcerative colitis in detecting the microscopic activity of the disease in people and predicting when flare-ups will happen. For example, an AI-powered tool  was developed to analyse digitised bowel samples ( biopsies ). The tool was able to distinguish with 80% accuracy between samples that show remission of colitis and those with active disease. It also predicted the risk of a flare-up happening with the same accuracy. These rates of successfully using microscopic disease activity to predict disease flare are similar to the accuracy of pathologists . [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Obstetrics and gynaecology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence utilises massive amounts of data to help with predicting illness, prevention, and diagnosis, as well as patient monitoring. In obstetrics, artificial intelligence is utilized in magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and foetal cardiotocography. AI contributes in the resolution of a variety of obstetrical diagnostic issues. [ 74 ] Infectious diseases [ edit ] AI has shown potential in both the laboratory and clinical spheres of infectious disease medicine. [ 75 ] During the COVID-19 pandemic , AI has been used for early detection, tracking virus spread and analysing virus behaviour, among other things. [ 76 ] However, there were only a few examples of AI being used directly in clinical practice during the pandemic itself. [ 77 ] Other applications  of AI around infectious diseases include support-vector machines identifying antimicrobial resistance , machine learning analysis of blood smears to detect malaria , and improved point-of-care testing of Lyme disease based on antigen detection. Additionally, AI has been investigated for improving diagnosis of meningitis , sepsis , and tuberculosis , as well as predicting treatment complications in hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients. [ 75 ] Musculoskeletal [ edit ] AI has been used to identify causes of knee pain that doctors miss, that disproportionately affect Black patients. [ 78 ] Underserved populations experience higher levels of pain. These disparities persist even after controlling for the objective severity of diseases like osteoarthritis, as graded by human physicians using medical images, raising the possibility that underserved patients\u2019 pain stems from factors external to the knee, such as stress. Researchers have conducted a study using a machine-learning algorithm to show that standard radiographic measures of severity overlook objective but undiagnosed features that disproportionately affect diagnosis and management of underserved populations with knee pain. They proposed that new algorithmic measure ALG-P could potentially enable expanded access to treatments for underserved patients. [ 79 ] Neurology [ edit ] The use of AI technologies has been explored for use in the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For diagnostic purposes, machine learning models have been developed that rely on structural MRI inputs. [ 80 ] The input datasets for these models are drawn from databases such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. [ 81 ] Researchers have developed models that rely on convolutional neural networks with the aim of improving early diagnostic accuracy. [ 82 ] Generative adversarial networks are a form of deep learning that have also performed well in diagnosing AD. [ 83 ] There have also been efforts to develop machine learning models into forecasting tools that can predict the prognosis of patients with AD. Forecasting patient outcomes through generative models has been proposed by researchers as a means of synthesizing training and validation sets. [ 84 ] They suggest that generated patient forecasts could be used to provide future models larger training datasets than current open access databases. Oncology [ edit ] AI has been explored for use in cancer diagnosis, risk stratification, molecular characterization of tumors, and cancer drug discovery. A particular challenge in oncologic care that AI is being developed to address is the ability to accurately predict which treatment protocols will be best suited for each patient based on their individual genetic, molecular, and tumor-based characteristics. [ 85 ] AI has been trialed in cancer diagnostics with the reading of imaging studies and pathology slides. [ 86 ] In January 2020, Google DeepMind announced an algorithm capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer detection in screening scans. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] A number of researchers, including Trevor Hastie , Joelle Pineau , and Robert Tibshirani among others, published a reply claiming that DeepMind's research publication in Nature lacked key details on methodology and code, \"effectively undermin[ing] its scientific value\" and making it impossible for the scientific community to confirm the work. [ 89 ] In the MIT Technology Review , author Benjamin Haibe-Kains characterized DeepMind's work as \"an advertisement\" having little to do with science. [ 90 ] In July 2020, it was reported that an AI algorithm developed by the University of Pittsburgh achieves the highest accuracy to date in identifying prostate cancer , with 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] In 2023 a study reported the use of AI for CT -based radiomics classification at grading the aggressiveness of retroperitoneal sarcoma with 82% accuracy compared with 44% for lab analysis of biopsies. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Ophthalmology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence-enhanced technology is being used as an aid in the screening of eye disease and prevention of blindness. [ 95 ] In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the marketing of the first medical device to diagnose a specific type of eye disease, diabetic retinopathy using an artificial intelligence algorithm. [ 96 ] Moreover, AI technology may be used to further improve \"diagnosis rates\" because of the potential to decrease detection time. [ 97 ] Pathology [ edit ] Further information: Digital pathology Ki67 stain calculation by the open-source software QuPath in a pure seminoma, which gives a measure of the proliferation rate of the tumor. The colors represent the intensity of expression: blue-no expression, yellow-low, orange-moderate, and red-high expression. [ 98 ] For many diseases, pathological analysis of cells and tissues is considered to be the gold standard of disease diagnosis. Methods of digital pathology allows microscopy slides to be scanned and digitally analyzed. AI-assisted pathology tools have been developed to assist with the diagnosis of a number of diseases, including breast cancer, hepatitis B, gastric cancer , and colorectal cancer . AI has also been used to predict genetic mutations and prognosticate disease outcomes. [ 71 ] AI is well-suited for use in low-complexity pathological analysis of large-scale screening samples, such as colorectal or breast cancer screening, thus lessening the burden on pathologists and allowing for faster turnaround of sample analysis. [ 99 ] Several deep learning and artificial neural network models have shown accuracy similar to that of human pathologists, [ 99 ] and a study of deep learning assistance in diagnosing metastatic breast cancer in lymph nodes showed that the accuracy of humans with the assistance of a deep learning program was higher than either the humans alone or the AI program alone. [ 100 ] Additionally, implementation of digital pathology is predicted to save over $12 million for a university center over the course of five years, [ 101 ] though savings attributed to AI specifically have not yet been widely researched. The use of augmented and virtual reality could prove to be a stepping stone to wider implementation of AI-assisted pathology, as they can highlight areas of concern on a pathology sample and present them in real-time to a pathologist for more efficient review. [ 99 ] AI also has the potential to identify histological findings at levels beyond what the human eye can see, [ 99 ] and has shown the ability to use genotypic and phenotypic data to more accurately detect the tumor of origin for metastatic cancer. [ 102 ] One of the major current barriers to widespread implementation of AI-assisted pathology tools is the lack of prospective, randomized, multi-center controlled trials in determining the true clinical utility of AI for pathologists and patients, highlighting a current area of need in AI and healthcare research. [ 99 ] Primary care [ edit ] Primary care has become one key development area for AI technologies. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] AI in primary care has been used for supporting decision making, predictive modeling, and business analytics. [ 105 ] There are only a few examples of AI decision support systems that were prospectively assessed on clinical efficacy when used in practice by physicians. But there are cases where the use of these systems yielded a positive effect on treatment choice by physicians. [ 106 ] As of 2022 in relation to elder care, AI robots had been helpful in guiding older residents living in assisted living with entertainment and company. These bots are allowing staff in the home to have more one-on-one time with each resident, but the bots are also programmed with more ability in what they are able to do; such as knowing different languages and different types of care depending on the patient's conditions. The bot is an AI machine, which means it goes through the same training as any other machine - using algorithms to parse the given data, learn from it and predict the outcome in relation to what situation is at hand. [ 107 ] Psychiatry [ edit ] In psychiatry, AI applications are still in a phase of proof-of-concept. [ 108 ] Areas where the evidence is widening quickly include predictive modelling of diagnosis and treatment outcomes, [ 109 ] chatbots, conversational agents that imitate human behaviour and which have been studied for anxiety and depression. [ 110 ] Challenges include the fact that many applications in the field are developed and proposed by private corporations, such as the screening for suicidal ideation implemented by Facebook in 2017. [ 111 ] Such applications outside the healthcare system raise various professional, ethical and regulatory questions. [ 112 ] Another issue is often with the validity and interpretability of the models. Small training datasets contain bias that is inherited by the models, and compromises the generalizability and stability of these models. Such models may also have the potential to be discriminatory against minority groups that are underrepresented in samples. [ 113 ] In 2023, US-based National Eating Disorders Association replaced its human helpline staff with a chatbot but had to take it offline after users reported receiving harmful advice from it. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] Radiology [ edit ] AI is being studied within the field of radiology to detect and diagnose diseases through computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. [ 117 ] It may be particularly useful in settings where demand for human expertise exceeds supply, or where data is too complex to be efficiently interpreted by human readers. [ 118 ] Several deep learning models have shown the capability to be roughly as accurate as healthcare professionals in identifying diseases through medical imaging, though few of the studies reporting these findings have been externally validated. [ 119 ] AI can also provide non-interpretive benefit to radiologists, such as reducing noise in images, creating high-quality images from lower doses of radiation, enhancing MR image quality, [ 120 ] and automatically assessing image quality. [ 121 ] Further research investigating the use of AI in nuclear medicine focuses on image reconstruction, anatomical landmarking, and the enablement of lower doses in imaging studies. [ 122 ] The analysis of images for supervised AI applications in radiology encompasses two primary techniques at present: (1) convolutional neural network-based analysis; and (2) utilization of radiomics . [ 118 ] AI is also used in breast imaging for analyzing screening mammograms and can participate in improving breast cancer detection rate [ 123 ] as well as reducing radiologist's reading workload. Pharmacy [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Artificial intelligence in pharmacy . [ edit ] This article may require copy editing for grammar, style, cohesion, tone, or spelling . You can assist by editing it . ( May 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Part of a series on Artificial intelligence (AI) Major goals Artificial general intelligence Intelligent agent Recursive self-improvement Planning Computer vision General game playing Knowledge representation Natural language processing Robotics AI safety Approaches Machine learning Symbolic Deep learning Bayesian networks Evolutionary algorithms Hybrid intelligent systems Systems integration Applications Bioinformatics Deepfake Earth sciences Finance Generative AI Art Audio Music Government Healthcare Mental health Industry Translation Military Physics Projects Philosophy Artificial consciousness Chinese room Friendly AI Control problem / Takeover Ethics Existential risk Turing test Uncanny valley History Timeline Progress AI winter AI boom Glossary Glossary v t e Artificial Intelligence (AI) [ 124 ] [ 125 ] [ 126 ] is a field of computer science in which a huge amount of data is fed to a machine learning model, which allows the machine to learn patterns from that data and is able to make smart, calculated decisions, which can only be achieved by human intelligence . Artificial intelligence is playing a crucial role in driving the application and research in many fields and pharmacy is no exception. In pharmacy, the use of AI is leading to the discovery, development, and delivery of medications , and also enhancing patient care through personalized treatment plans. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] This article is going to summarize AI's application in drug research, drug safety, dose recommendation and examine the limitations and future directions of AI in pharmacy. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Industry [ edit ] The trend of large health companies merging allows for greater health data accessibility. Greater health data lays the groundwork for the implementation of AI algorithms. A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the clinical decision support systems . As more data is collected, machine learning algorithms adapt and allow for more robust responses and solutions. [ 117 ] Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of big data in the healthcare industry. Many companies investigate the market opportunities through the realms of \"data assessment, storage, management, and analysis technologies\" which are all crucial parts of the healthcare industry. [ 131 ] With the market for AI expanding constantly, large tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Baidu all have their own AI research divisions, as well as millions of dollars allocated for acquisition of smaller AI based companies. [ 131 ] The following are examples of large companies that are contributing to AI algorithms for use in healthcare: Amazon Web Services [ 132 ] Apple [ 132 ] Google 's DeepMind platform is being used by the UK National Health Service to detect certain health risks through data collected via a mobile app. A second project with the NHS involves the analysis of medical images collected from NHS patients to develop computer vision algorithms to detect cancerous tissues. IBM's Watson Oncology is in development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Cleveland Clinic . IBM is also working with CVS Health on AI applications in chronic disease treatment and with Johnson & Johnson on analysis of scientific papers to find new connections for drug development. In May 2017, IBM and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute began a joint project entitled Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning and Semantics (HEALS) , to explore using AI technology to enhance healthcare. Intel's venture capital arm Intel Capital invested in 2016 in the startup Lumiata, which uses AI to identify at-risk patients and develop care options. [ 133 ] Meta [ 132 ] Microsoft 's Hanover project, in partnership with Oregon Health & Science University 's Knight Cancer Institute, analyzes medical research to predict the most effective cancer drug treatment options for patients. Other projects include medical image analysis of tumor progression and the development of programmable cells. [ 134 ] Neuralink has come up with a next-generation neuroprosthetic which intricately interfaces with thousands of neural pathways in the brain. [ 117 ] Their process allows a chip, roughly the size of a quarter, to be inserted in the place of a chunk of a skull by a precision surgical robot to avoid accidental injury . [ 117 ] Elon Musk premiering the surgical robot that implants the Neuralink brain chip Ava Industries Ltd., a Canadian healthcare technology firm, is developing integrated AI tools to support clinical efficiency. Ava has implemented an embedded AI medical scribe within theis electronic medical record system (EMR) and is further developing tools such as an AI chart summarizer and an AI document classifier. [1] The company has received support through grants from Canada Health Infowayfor its work in advancing digital health solutions. [2] Tencent is working on several medical systems and services. These include AI Medical Innovation System (AIMIS) , an AI-powered diagnostic medical imaging service; WeChat Intelligent Healthcare; and Tencent Doctorwork Digital consultant apps use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user's medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution[ buzzword ] to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user (e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus) and value capturing mechanisms (e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders). IFlytek launched a service robot \"Xiao Man\", which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas. [ citation needed ] It also works in the field of medical imaging. Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH (\"Cruzr\") and Softbank Robotics (\"Pepper\"). [ citation needed ] The Indian startup Haptik developed a WhatsApp chatbot in 2021 which answers questions associated with the deadly coronavirus in India . Similarly, a software platform ChatBot in partnership with medtech startup Infermedica launched COVID-19 Risk Assessment ChatBot. [ 135 ] Many automobile manufacturers are beginning to use machine learning healthcare in their cars as well. [ 131 ] Companies such as BMW , GE , Tesla , Toyota , and Volvo all have new research campaigns to find ways of learning a driver's vital statistics to ensure they are awake, paying attention to the road, and not under the influence of substances. [ 131 ] Expanding care to developing nations [ edit ] Artificial intelligence continues to expand in its abilities to diagnose more people accurately in nations where fewer doctors are accessible to the public.\u00a0 Many new technology companies such as SpaceX and the Raspberry Pi Foundation have enabled more developing countries to have access to computers and the internet than ever before. [ 136 ] With the increasing capabilities of AI over the internet, advanced machine learning algorithms can allow patients to get accurately diagnosed when they would previously have no way of knowing if they had a life-threatening disease or not. [ 136 ] Using AI in developing nations that do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can improve patient care. AI can allow for not only diagnosis of patient in areas where healthcare is scarce, but also allow for a good patient experience by resourcing files to find the best treatment for a patient. [ 137 ] The ability of AI to adjust course as it goes also allows the patient to have their treatment modified based on what works for them; a level of individualized care that is nearly non-existent in developing countries. [ 137 ] Regulation [ edit ] This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( May 2025 ) Challenges of the clinical use of AI have brought about a potential need for regulations . AI studies need to be completely and transparently reported to have value to inform regulatory approval. Depending on the phase of study, international consensus-based reporting guidelines (TRIPOD+AI, [ 138 ] DECIDE-AI, [ 139 ] CONSORT-AI [ 140 ] ) have been developed to provide recommendations on the key details that need to be reported. A man speaking at the GDPR compliance workshop at the 2019 Entrepreneurship Summit While regulations exist pertaining to the collection of patient data such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the US ( HIPAA ) and the European General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) pertaining to patients within the EU, health care AI is \u201c\"severely under-regulated worldwide\" as of 2025. [ 132 ] Unclear is whether healthcare AI can be classified merely as software or as medical device . [ 132 ] United Nations (WHO/ITU) [ edit ] The joint ITU - WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H) has built a platform - known as the ITU-WHO AI for Health Framework - for the testing and benchmarking of AI applications in health domain. As of November 2018, eight use cases are being benchmarked, including assessing breast cancer risk from histopathological imagery, guiding anti-venom selection from snake images, and diagnosing skin lesions. USA [ edit ] United States Food & Drug Administration [ 141 ] In 2015, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued rules and regulations to protect the privacy of individuals\u2019 health information,  requiring healthcare providers to follow certain privacy rules when using AI, to keep a record of how they use AI and to ensure that their AI systems are secure. [ 142 ] In May 2016, the White House announced its plan to host a series of workshops and formation of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. [ citation needed ] In October 2016, the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, outlining its proposed priorities for Federally-funded AI research and development (within government and academia). The report notes a strategic R&D plan for the subfield of health information technology was in development stages. [ citation needed ] In January 2021, the US FDA published a new Action Plan, entitled Artificial Intelligence (AI) /Machine Learning (ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) Action Plan. [ 143 ] It layed out the FDA's future plans for regulation of medical devices that would include artificial intelligence in their software with five main actions: 1. Tailored Regulatory Framework for Ai/M:-based SaMD, 2. Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP), 3. Patient-Centered Approach Incorporating Transparency to Users, 4. Regulatory Science Methods Related to Algorithm Bias & Robustness, and 5. Real-World Performance(RWP). This plan was in direct response to stakeholders' feedback on a 2019 discussion paper also published by the FDA. [ 143 ] Under President Biden the DHSS and the National Institute of Standards and Technology were instructed to develop regulation of healthcare AI. [ 132 ] According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , the OCR issued guidance on the ethical use of AI in healthcare in 2021. It outlined four core ethical principles that must be followed: respect for autonomy , beneficence (ethics) , non-maleficence , and justice. Respect for autonomy requires that individuals have control over their own data and decisions. Beneficence requires that AI be used to do good, such as improving the quality of care and reducing health disparities. Non-maleficence requires that AI be used to do no harm, such as avoiding discrimination in decisions. Finally, justice requires that AI be used fairly, such as using the same standards for decisions no matter a person's race, gender, or income level. As of March 2021, the OCR had hired a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (OCAIO) to pursue the \"implementation of the HHS AI strategy\". [ 144 ] With the second Trump administration deregulation of health AI began on January 20, 2025 with merely voluntary standards for collecting and sharing data, statutory definitions for algorithmic discrimination, automation bias, and equity being cancelled, cuts to NIST and 19% of FDA workforce eliminated. [ 132 ] Europe [ edit ] Other countries have implemented data protection regulations, more specifically with company privacy invasions. In Denmark, the Danish Expert Group on data ethics has adopted recommendations on 'Data for the Benefit of the People'. These recommendations are intended to encourage the responsible use of data in the business sector, with a focus on data processing. The recommendations include a focus on equality and non-discrimination with regard to bias in AI, as well as human dignity which is to outweigh profit and must be respected in all data processes. [ 145 ] The European Union has implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect citizens' personal data, which applies to the use of AI in healthcare. In addition, the European Commission has established guidelines to ensure the ethical development of AI, including the use of algorithms to ensure fairness and transparency. [ 146 ] With GDPR, the European Union was the first to regulate AI through data protection legislation. The Union finds privacy as a fundamental human right, it wants to prevent unconsented and secondary uses of data by private or public health facilities. By streamlining access to personal data for health research and findings, they are able to instate the right and importance of patient privacy. [ 146 ] In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires organizations to protect the privacy and security of patient information. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have also released guidelines for the development of AI-based medical applications. [ 147 ] In 2025, Europe was leading the USA on AI regulation, while lagging in innovation and at least one California-based biotech company was \"engaging the European Medicines Agency earlier in development than previously anticipated to mitigate concerns about the FDA's ability to meet development timelines.\" [ 132 ] Ethical concerns [ edit ] While research on the use of AI in healthcare aims to validate its efficacy in improving patient outcomes before its broader adoption, its use may introduce several new types of risk to patients and healthcare providers, such as algorithmic bias , Do not resuscitate implications, and other machine morality issues. AI may also compromise the protection of patients' rights, such as the right to informed consent and the right to medical data protection. [ 148 ] Data collection, privacy - autonomy [ edit ] In order to effectively train Machine Learning and use AI in healthcare, massive amounts of data must be gathered. Acquiring this data, however, comes at the cost of patient privacy , i.e. autonomy in most cases and is not well received publicly. For example, a survey conducted in the UK estimated that 63% of the population is uncomfortable with sharing their personal data in order to improve artificial intelligence technology. [ 149 ] The scarcity of real, accessible patient data is a hindrance that deters the progress of developing and deploying more artificial intelligence in healthcare. The lack of regulations surrounding AI in the United States has generated concerns about mismanagement of patient data, such as with corporations utilizing patient data for financial gain. For example, as of 2020 Roche , a Swiss healthcare company, was found to have purchased healthcare data for approximately 2 million cancer patients at an estimated total cost of $1.9 billion. [ 150 ] Naturally, this generates questions of ethical concern; Is there a monetary price that can be set for data, and should it depend on its perceived value or contributions to science? Is it fair to patients to sell their data? These concerns were addressed in a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2022 that asked Americans for their opinions about the increased presence of AI in their daily lives, and the survey estimated that 37% of Americans were more concerned than excited about such increased presence, with 8% of participants specifically associating their concern with \"people misusing AI\". [ 151 ] Ultimately, the current potential of artificial intelligence in healthcare is additionally hindered by  concerns about mismanagement of data collected, especially in the United States. Automation- beneficence [ edit ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic , or fulfill beneficence . [ 16 ] According to a 2019 study, AI can replace up to 35% of jobs in the UK within the next 10 to 20 years. [ 152 ] However, of these jobs, it was concluded that AI has not eliminated any healthcare jobs so far. Though if AI were to automate healthcare-related jobs, the jobs most susceptible to automation would be those dealing with digital information, radiology, and pathology, as opposed to those dealing with doctor-to-patient interaction. [ 152 ] Ouutputs can be incorrect or incomplete and diagnosis and recommendations harm people. [ 132 ] Bias, discrimination [ edit ] Since AI makes decisions solely on the data it receives as input, it is important that this data represents accurate patient demographics. In a hospital setting, patients do not have full knowledge of how predictive algorithms are created or calibrated. Therefore, these medical establishments can unfairly code their algorithms to discriminate against minorities and prioritize profits rather than providing optimal care, i.e. violating the ethical principle of social justice or non-maleficence . [ 153 ] A recent scoping review identified 18 equity challenges along with 15 strategies that can be implemented to help address them when AI applications are developed using many-to-many mapping. [ 154 ] There can be unintended bias in algorithms that can exacerbate social and healthcare inequities. [ 153 ] Since AI's decisions are a direct reflection of its input data, the data it receives must have accurate representation of patient demographics. For instance, if populations are less represented in healthcare data it is likely to create bias in AI tools that lead to incorrect assumptions of a demographic and impact the ability to provide appropriate care. [ 155 ] White males are overly represented in medical data sets. [ 156 ] Therefore, having minimal patient data on minorities can lead to AI making more accurate predictions for majority populations, leading to unintended worse medical outcomes for minority populations. [ 157 ] Collecting data from minority communities can also lead to medical discrimination. For instance, HIV is a prevalent virus among minority communities and HIV status can be used to discriminate against patients. [ 156 ] In addition to biases that may arise from sample selection, different clinical systems used to collect data may also impact AI functionality. For example, radiographic systems and their outcomes (e.g., resolution) vary by provider. Moreover, clinician work practices, such as the positioning of the patient for radiography, can also greatly influence the data and make comparability difficult. [ 158 ] However, these biases are able to be eliminated through careful implementation and a methodical collection of representative data. A final source of algorithmic bias , which has been called \"label choice bias\", arises when proxy measures are used to train algorithms, that build in bias against certain groups. For example, a widely used algorithm predicted health care costs as a proxy for health care needs, and used predictions to allocate resources to help patients with complex health needs. This introduced bias because Black patients have lower costs, even when they are just as unhealthy as White patients. [ 159 ] Solutions to the \"label choice bias\" aim to match the actual target (what the algorithm is predicting) more closely to the ideal target (what researchers want the algorithm to predict), so for the prior example, instead of predicting cost, researchers would focus on the variable of healthcare needs which is rather more significant. Adjusting the target led to almost double the number of Black patients being selected for the program. History [ edit ] Research in the 1960s and 1970s produced the first problem-solving program, or expert system , known as Dendral . [ 160 ] [ 161 ] While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry, it provided the basis for a subsequent system MYCIN , [ 162 ] considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine. [ 162 ] [ 163 ] MYCIN and other systems such as INTERNIST-1 and CASNET did not achieve routine use by practitioners, however. [ 164 ] The 1980s and 1990s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity. During this time, there was a recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physicians. [ 165 ] Approaches involving fuzzy set theory, [ 166 ] Bayesian networks , [ 167 ] and artificial neural networks , [ 168 ] [ 169 ] have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare. Medical and technological advancements occurring over this half-century period that have enabled the growth of healthcare-related applications of AI to include: Improvements in computing power resulting in faster data collection and data processing [ 170 ] Growth of genomic sequencing databases [ 171 ] Widespread implementation of electronic health record systems [ 172 ] Improvements in natural language processing and computer vision , enabling machines to replicate human perceptual processes [ 173 ] [ 174 ] Enhanced the precision of robot-assisted surgery [ 175 ] Increased tree-based machine learning models that allow flexibility in establishing health predictors [ 176 ] Improvements in deep learning techniques and data logs for rare diseases See also [ edit ] AI alignment Artificial intelligence in mental health Artificial intelligence Glossary of artificial intelligence Full body scanner (i.e. Dermascanner , ...)

For instance, Microsoft Research, Cambridge, has been using AI to transform medical research practices.\n\nDespite the promising potential of AI, there are challenges that need to be addressed. AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on, and bias in this data can lead to incorrect or partial outcomes. Furthermore, the security of sensitive patient data is paramount, and AI systems must be designed with robust security measures to prevent attacks such as phishing and DDoS, which can disrupt normal activity and deny access to legitimate users.\n\nIn conclusion, while AI in healthcare is still in its early stages, the existing case studies show a future where AI can significantly improve the efficiency and quality of healthcare. However, to fully harness the power of AI, there needs to be a conscious effort to address the challenges associated with data bias and security. With continued research and development, the transformative effect of AI on healthcare is set to accelerate, reshaping the way medicine is practiced and healthcare is delivered.\n\n## Challenges and Limitations of AI in Healthcare\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has shown immense promise in the healthcare sector, promising to revolutionize medicine and healthcare delivery. However, despite the potential benefits and advancements, AI in healthcare also presents a set of unique challenges and limitations that need to be addressed.\n\nOne of the most notable challenges in implementing AI in healthcare is the issue of data privacy and security. Given that AI systems typically require large amounts of data to function effectively, there are legitimate concerns about how patient data is collected, stored, and used. A study by IBM highlights the risk of data breaches, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and phishing, which can disrupt AI systems and compromise patient data. In addition, there are concerns about the misuse of data, particularly in the context of data mining and the generation of AI applications.\n\nMoreover, the integration of AI into clinical practice also presents a significant challenge. As noted by Mesk\u00f3 and G\u00f6r\u00f6g, while there is a considerable amount of hype and attention around AI in healthcare, there are only a few practical examples of its medical use with sufficient evidence. This indicates a gap between theoretical potential and practical application. Healthcare professionals may also face difficulties in understanding and adapting to AI technologies, due to their complexity and the fast pace of technological development.\n\nAnother major limitation of AI in healthcare is the lack of transparency and interpretability. AI algorithms, particularly those based on complex deep learning methods, are often described as 'black boxes', making it difficult for clinicians to understand how they make their decisions. This lack of transparency can lead to mistrust and reluctance in adopting AI technologies, and it also raises ethical and legal issues, especially in the event of an adverse outcome.\n\nLastly, there is the challenge of ensuring AI systems' generalizability and reliability. AI systems trained on data from a specific population may not perform as well when applied to a different population, due to differences in demographics, disease prevalence, and healthcare systems. Furthermore, even small changes in input data can lead to significantly different outputs, raising questions about the reliability of AI-driven decisions and predictions.\n\nDespite these challenges and limitations, it is important to note that they are not insurmountable. With the right regulatory frameworks, technological advancements, and training for healthcare professionals, AI has the potential to play a transformative role in healthcare. However, it is crucial that these issues are acknowledged and addressed in order to ensure that the benefits of AI in healthcare can be fully realized.\n\n## Ethical Considerations of AI in Healthcare\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is projected to significantly impact the field of medicine and healthcare delivery in the not-so-distant future. While there are a limited number of practical examples of its medical use backed by sufficient evidence, the hype and attention surrounding the topic are substantial. However, amidst the excitement and promise that AI holds, ethical considerations cannot be overlooked.\n\nAI in healthcare, from data mining to chatbots, brings about a myriad of ethical implications. One such implication is the concern around patient privacy. AI technologies often require vast quantities of data to function effectively, and in healthcare, this data is often sensitive and personal. While such data can be de-identified, the risk of re-identification always exists, posing a threat to patient confidentiality.\n\nIn addition to privacy, there's also the question of consent. In traditional medical settings, patients are typically well-informed about procedures and treatments before giving their consent. However, in the age of AI, this may not always be the case. For instance, patients may not fully understand how AI is used in their care or how their data is being utilized by AI systems.\n\nMoreover, the use of AI in healthcare also brings into focus the issue of bias. AI systems are trained using data sets, and these sets may not always be representative of the diverse patient population. This could potentially lead to biased algorithms, which in turn could result in unequal healthcare delivery.\n\nThere's also the concern of overdependence on AI.

In this review article, we outline recent breakthroughs in the application of AI in healthcare, describe a roadmap to building effective, reliable and safe AI systems, and discuss the possible future direction of AI augmented healthcare systems. KEYWORDS: AI, digital health Introduction Healthcare systems around the world face significant challenges in achieving the \u2018quadruple aim\u2019 for healthcare: improve population health, improve the patient's experience of care, enhance caregiver experience and reduce the rising cost of care. 1\u20133 Ageing populations, growing burden of chronic diseases and rising costs of healthcare globally are challenging governments, payers, regulators and providers to innovate and transform models of healthcare delivery. Moreover, against a backdrop now catalysed by the global pandemic, healthcare systems find themselves challenged to \u2018perform\u2019 (deliver effective, high-quality care) and \u2018transform\u2019 care at scale by leveraging real-world data driven insights directly into patient care. The pandemic has also highlighted the shortages in healthcare workforce and inequities in the access to care, previously articulated by The King's Fund and the World Health Organization (Box 1 ). 4,5 Box 1. Workforce challenges in the next decade By 2030, the gap between supply of and demand for staff employed by NHS trusts could increase to almost 250,000 full-time equivalent posts. 4 Based on the current trends and needs of the global population by 2030, the world will have 18 million fewer healthcare professionals (especially marked differences in the developing world), including 5 million fewer doctors than society will require. 5 Open in a new tab The application of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has the potential to address some of these supply-and-demand challenges. The increasing availability of multi-modal data (genomics, economic, demographic, clinical and phenotypic) coupled with technology innovations in mobile, internet of things (IoT), computing power and data security herald a moment of convergence between healthcare and technology to fundamentally transform models of healthcare delivery through AI-augmented healthcare systems. In particular, cloud computing is enabling the transition of effective and safe AI systems into mainstream healthcare delivery. Cloud computing is providing the computing capacity for the analysis of considerably large amounts of data, at higher speeds and lower costs compared with historic \u2018on premises\u2019 infrastructure of healthcare organisations. Indeed, we observe that many technology providers are increasingly seeking to partner with healthcare organisations to drive AI-driven medical innovation enabled by cloud computing and technology-related transformation (Box 2 ). 6\u20138 Box 2. Quotes from technology leaders Satya Nadella, chief executive officer, Microsoft: \u2018AI is perhaps the most transformational technology of our time, and healthcare is perhaps AI's most pressing application.\u2019 6 Tim Cook, chief executive officer, Apple: \u2018[Healthcare] is a business opportunity ... if you look at it, medical health activity is the largest or second-largest component of the economy.\u2019 7 Google Health: \u2018We think that AI is poised to transform medicine, delivering new, assistive technologies that will empower doctors to better serve their patients. Machine learning has dozens of possible application areas, but healthcare stands out as a remarkable opportunity to benefit people.\u2019 8 Open in a new tab Here, we summarise recent breakthroughs in the application of AI in healthcare, describe a roadmap to building effective AI systems and discuss the possible future direction of AI augmented healthcare systems. What is artificial intelligence? Simply put, AI refers to the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, through algorithms or a set of rules, which the machine follows to mimic human cognitive functions, such as learning and problem solving. 9 AI systems have the potential to anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up and, as such, operate in an intentional, intelligent and adaptive manner. 10 AI's strength is in its ability to learn and recognise patterns and relationships from large multidimensional and multimodal datasets; for example, AI systems could translate a patient's entire medical record into a single number that represents a likely diagnosis. 11,12 Moreover, AI systems are dynamic and autonomous, learning and adapting as more data become available. 13 AI is not one ubiquitous, universal technology, rather, it represents several subfields (such as machine learning and deep learning) that, individually or in combination, add intelligence to applications. Machine learning (ML) refers to the study of algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience. 14 ML itself may be categorised as \u2018supervised\u2019, \u2018unsupervised\u2019 and \u2018reinforcement learning\u2019 (RL), and there is ongoing research in various sub-fields including \u2018semi-supervised\u2019, \u2018self-supervised\u2019 and \u2018multi-instance\u2019 ML. Supervised learning leverages labelled data (annotated information); for example, using labelled X-ray images of known tumours to detect tumours in new images. 15 \u2018Unsupervised learning\u2019 attempts to extract information from data without labels; for example, categorising groups of patients with similar symptoms to identify a common cause. 16 In RL, computational agents learn by trial and error, or by expert demonstration. The algorithm learns by developing a strategy to maximise rewards. Of note, major breakthroughs in AI in recent years have been based on RL. Deep learning (DL) is a class of algorithms that learns by using a large, many-layered collection of connected processes and exposing these processors to a vast set of examples. DL has emerged as the predominant method in AI today driving improvements in areas such as image and speech recognition. 17,18 How to build effective and trusted AI-augmented healthcare systems? Despite more than a decade of significant focus, the use and adoption of AI in clinical practice remains limited, with many AI products for healthcare still at the design and develop stage. 19\u201322 While there are different ways to build AI systems for healthcare, far too often there are attempts to force square pegs into round holes ie find healthcare problems to apply AI solutions to without due consideration to local context (such as clinical workflows, user needs, trust, safety and ethical implications). We hold the view that AI amplifies and augments, rather than replaces, human intelligence. Hence, when building AI systems in healthcare, it is key to not replace the important elements of the human interaction in medicine but to focus it, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of that interaction. Moreover, AI innovations in healthcare will come through an in-depth, human-centred understanding of the complexity of patient journeys and care pathways. In Fig 1 , we describe a problem-driven, human-centred approach, adapted from frameworks by Wiens et al , Care and Sendak to building effective and reliable AI-augmented healthcare systems. 23\u201325 Fig 1. Open in a new tab Multi-step, iterative approach to build effective and reliable AI-augmented systems in healthcare. Design and develop The first stage is to design and develop AI solutions for the right problems using a human-centred AI and experimentation approach and engaging appropriate stakeholders, especially the healthcare users themselves. Stakeholder engagement and co-creation Build a multidisciplinary team including computer and social scientists, operational and research leadership, and clinical stakeholders (physician, caregivers and patients) and subject experts (eg for biomedical scientists) that would include authorisers, motivators, financiers, conveners, connectors, implementers and champions. 26 A multi-stakeholder team brings the technical, strategic, operational expertise to define problems, goals, success metrics and intermediate milestones. Human-centred AI A human-centred AI approach combines an ethnographic understanding of health systems, with AI. Through user-designed research, first understand the key problems (we suggest using a qualitative study design to understand \u2018what is the problem\u2019, \u2018why is it a problem\u2019, \u2018to whom does it matter\u2019, \u2018why has it not been addressed before\u2019 and \u2018why is it not getting attention\u2019) including the needs, constraints and workflows in healthcare organisations, and the facilitators and barriers to the integration of AI within the clinical context. After defining key problems, the next step is to identify which problems are appropriate for AI to solve, whether there is availability of applicable datasets to build and later evaluate AI. By contextualising algorithms in an existing workflow, AI systems would operate within existing norms and practices to ensure adoption, providing appropriate solutions to existing problems for the end user. Experimentation The focus should be on piloting of new stepwise experiments to build AI tools, using tight feedback loops from stakeholders to facilitate rapid experiential learning and incremental changes. 27 The experiments would allow the trying out of new ideas simultaneously, exploring to see which one works, learn what works and what doesn't, and why. 28 Experimentation and feedback will help to elucidate the purpose and intended uses for the AI system: the likely end users and the potential harm and ethical implications of AI system to them (for instance, data privacy, security, equity and safety). Evaluate and validate Next, we must iteratively evaluate and validate the predictions made by the AI tool to test how well it is functioning. This is critical, and evaluation is based on three dimensions: statistical validity, clinical utility and economic utility. Statistical validity is understanding the performance of AI on metrics of accuracy, reliability, robustness, stability and calibration. High model performance on retrospective, in silico settings is not sufficient to demonstrate clinical utility or impact. To determine clinical utility, evaluate the algorithm in a real-time environment on a hold-out and temporal validation set (eg longitudinal and external geographic datasets) to demonstrate clinical effectiveness and generalisability. 25 Economic utility quantifies the net benefit relative to the cost from the investment in the AI system. Scale and diffuse Many AI systems are initially designed to solve a problem at one healthcare system based on the patient population specific to that location and context. Scale up of AI systems requires special attention to deployment modalities, model updates, the regulatory system, variation between systems and reimbursement environment. Monitor and maintain Even after an AI system has been deployed clinically, it must be continually monitored and maintained to monitor for risks and adverse events using effective post-market surveillance. Healthcare organisations, regulatory bodies and AI developers should cooperate to collate and analyse the relevant datasets for AI performance, clinical and safety-related risks, and adverse events. 29 What are the current and future use cases of AI in healthcare? AI can enable healthcare systems to achieve their \u2018quadruple aim\u2019 by democratising and standardising a future of connected and AI augmented care, precision diagnostics, precision therapeutics and, ultimately, precision medicine (Table 1 ). 30 Research in the application of AI healthcare continues to accelerate rapidly, with potential use cases being demonstrated across the healthcare sector (both physical and mental health) including drug discovery, virtual clinical consultation, disease diagnosis, prognosis, medication management and health monitoring.

We describe a non-exhaustive suite of AI applications in healthcare in the near term, medium term and longer term, for the potential capabilities of AI to augment, automate and transform medicine. AI today (and in the near future) Currently, AI systems are not reasoning engines ie cannot reason the same way as human physicians, who can draw upon \u2018common sense\u2019 or \u2018clinical intuition and experience\u2019. 12 Instead, AI resembles a signal translator, translating patterns from datasets. AI systems today are beginning to be adopted by healthcare organisations to automate time consuming, high volume repetitive tasks. Moreover, there is considerable progress in demonstrating the use of AI in precision diagnostics (eg diabetic retinopathy and radiotherapy planning). AI in the medium term (the next 5\u201310 years) In the medium term, we propose that there will be significant progress in the development of powerful algorithms that are efficient (eg require less data to train), able to use unlabelled data, and can combine disparate structured and unstructured data including imaging, electronic health data, multi-omic, behavioural and pharmacological data. In addition, healthcare organisations and medical practices will evolve from being adopters of AI platforms, to becoming co-innovators with technology partners in the development of novel AI systems for precision therapeutics. AI in the long term (>10 years) In the long term, AI systems will become more intelligent , enabling AI healthcare systems achieve a state of precision medicine through AI-augmented healthcare and connected care. Healthcare will shift from the traditional one-size-fits-all form of medicine to a preventative, personalised, data-driven disease management model that achieves improved patient outcomes (improved patient and clinical experiences of care) in a more cost-effective delivery system. Connected/augmented care AI could significantly reduce inefficiency in healthcare, improve patient flow and experience, and enhance caregiver experience and patient safety through the care pathway; for example, AI could be applied to the remote monitoring of patients (eg intelligent telehealth through wearables/sensors) to identify and provide timely care of patients at risk of deterioration. In the long term, we expect that healthcare clinics, hospitals, social care services, patients and caregivers to be all connected to a single, interoperable digital infrastructure using passive sensors in combination with ambient intelligence. 31 Following are two AI applications in connected care. Virtual assistants and AI chatbots AI chatbots (such as those used in Babylon ( www.babylonhealth.com ) and Ada ( https://ada.com )) are being used by patients to identify symptoms and recommend further actions in community and primary care settings. AI chatbots can be integrated with wearable devices such as smartwatches to provide insights to both patients and caregivers in improving their behaviour, sleep and general wellness. Ambient and intelligent care We also note the emergence of ambient sensing without the need for any peripherals. Emerald ( www.emeraldinno.com ): a wireless, touchless sensor and machine learning platform for remote monitoring of sleep, breathing and behaviour, founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and researchers. Google nest: claiming to monitor sleep (including sleep disturbances like cough) using motion and sound sensors. 32 A recently published article exploring the ability to use smart speakers to contactlessly monitor heart rhythms. 33 Automation and ambient clinical intelligence: AI systems leveraging natural language processing (NLP) technology have the potential to automate administrative tasks such as documenting patient visits in electronic health records, optimising clinical workflow and enabling clinicians to focus more time on caring for patients (eg Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience ( www.nuance.com/healthcare/ambient-clinical-intelligence.html )). Precision diagnostics Diagnostic imaging The automated classification of medical images is the leading AI application today. A recent review of AI/ML-based medical devices approved in the USA and Europe from 2015\u20132020 found that more than half (129 (58%) devices in the USA and 126 (53%) devices in Europe) were approved or CE marked for radiological use. 34 Studies have demonstrated AI's ability to meet or exceed the performance of human experts in image-based diagnoses from several medical specialties including pneumonia in radiology (a convolutional neural network trained with labelled frontal chest X-ray images outperformed radiologists in detecting pneumonia), dermatology (a convolutional neural network was trained with clinical images and was found to classify skin lesions accurately), pathology (one study trained AI algorithms with whole-slide pathology images to detect lymph node metastases of breast cancer and compared the results with those of pathologists) and cardiology (a deep learning algorithm diagnosed heart attack with a performance comparable with that of cardiologists). 35\u201338 We recognise that there are some exemplars in this area in the NHS (eg University of Leeds Virtual Pathology Project and the National Pathology Imaging Co-operative) and expect widescale adoption and scaleup of AI-based diagnostic imaging in the medium term. 39 We provide two use cases of such technologies. Diabetic retinopathy screening Key to reducing preventable, diabetes-related vision loss worldwide is screening individuals for detection and the prompt treatment of diabetic retinopathy. However, screening is costly given the substantial number of diabetes patients and limited manpower for eye care worldwide. 40 Research studies on automated AI algorithms for diabetic retinopathy in the USA, Singapore, Thailand and India have demonstrated robust diagnostic performance and cost effectiveness. 41\u201344 Moreover, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved Medicare reimbursement for the use of Food and Drug Administration approved AI algorithm \u2018IDx-DR\u2019, which demonstrated 87% sensitivity and 90% specificity for detecting more-than-mild diabetic retinopathy. 45 Improving the precision and reducing waiting timings for radiotherapy planning An important AI application is to assist clinicians for image preparation and planning tasks for radiotherapy cancer treatment. Currently, segmentation of the images is time consuming and laborious task, performed manually by an oncologist using specially designed software to draw contours around the regions of interest. The AI-based InnerEye open-source technology can cut this preparation time for head and neck, and prostate cancer by up to 90%, meaning that waiting times for starting potentially life-saving radiotherapy treatment can be dramatically reduced (Fig 2 ). 46,47 Fig 2. Open in a new tab Potential applications for the InnerEye deep learning toolkit include quantitative radiology for monitoring tumour progression, planning for surgery and radiotherapy planning. 47 Precision therapeutics To make progress towards precision therapeutics, we need to considerably improve our understanding of disease. Researchers globally are exploring the cellular and molecular basis of disease, collecting a range of multimodal datasets that can lead to digital and biological biomarkers for diagnosis, severity and progression. Two important future AI applications include immunomics / synthetic biology and drug discovery. Immunomics and synthetic biology Through the application of AI tools on multimodal datasets in the future, we may be able to better understand the cellular basis of disease and the clustering of diseases and patient populations to provide more targeted preventive strategies, for example, using immunomics to diagnose and better predict care and treatment options. This will be revolutionary for multiple standards of care, with particular impact in the cancer, neurological and rare disease space, personalising the experience of care for the individual. AI-driven drug discovery AI will drive significant improvement in clinical trial design and optimisation of drug manufacturing processes, and, in general, any combinatorial optimisation process in healthcare could be replaced by AI. We have already seen the beginnings of this with the recent announcements by DeepMind and AlphaFold, which now sets the stage for better understanding disease processes, predicting protein structures and developing more targeted therapeutics (for both rare and more common diseases; Fig 3 ). 48,49 Fig 3. Open in a new tab An overview of the main neural network model architecture for AlphaFold. 49 MSA = multiple sequence alignment. Precision medicine New curative therapies Over the past decade, synthetic biology has produced developments like CRISPR gene editing and some personalised cancer therapies. However, the life cycle for developing such advanced therapies is still extremely inefficient and expensive. In future, with better access to data (genomic, proteomic, glycomic, metabolomic and bioinformatic), AI will allow us to handle far more systematic complexity and, in turn, help us transform the way we understand, discover and affect biology. This will improve the efficiency of the drug discovery process by helping better predict early which agents are more likely to be effective and also better anticipate adverse drug effects, which have often thwarted the further development of otherwise effective drugs at a costly late stage in the development process. This, in turn will democratise access to novel advanced therapies at a lower cost. AI empowered healthcare professionals In the longer term, healthcare professionals will leverage AI in augmenting the care they provide, allowing them to provide safer, standardised and more effective care at the top of their licence; for example, clinicians could use an \u2018AI digital consult\u2019 to examine \u2018digital twin\u2019 models of their patients (a truly \u2018digital and biomedical\u2019 version of a patient), allowing them to \u2018test\u2019 the effectiveness, safety and experience of an intervention (such as a cancer drug) in the digital environment prior to delivering the intervention to the patient in the real world. Challenges We recognise that there are significant challenges related to the wider adoption and deployment of AI into healthcare systems. These challenges include, but are not limited to, data quality and access, technical infrastructure, organisational capacity, and ethical and responsible practices in addition to aspects related to safety and regulation. Some of these issues have been covered, but others go beyond the scope of this current article. Conclusion and key recommendations Advances in AI have the potential to transform many aspects of healthcare, enabling a future that is more personalised, precise, predictive and portable. It is unclear if we will see an incremental adoption of new technologies or radical adoption of these technological innovations, but the impact of such technologies and the digital renaissance they bring requires health systems to consider how best they will adapt to the changing landscape. For the NHS, the application of such technologies truly has the potential to release time for care back to healthcare professionals, enabling them to focus on what matters to their patients and, in the future, leveraging a globally democratised set of data assets comprising the \u2018highest levels of human knowledge\u2019 to \u2018work at the limits of science\u2019 to deliver a common high standard of care, wherever and whenever it is delivered, and by whoever. 50 Globally, AI could become a key tool for improving health equity around the world. As much as the last 10 years have been about the roll out of digitisation of health records for the purposes of efficiency (and in some healthcare systems, billing/reimbursement), the next 10 years will be about the insight and value society can gain from these digital assets, and how these can be translated into driving better clinical outcomes with the assistance of AI, and the subsequent creation of novel data assets and tools. It is clear that we are at an turning point as it relates to the convergence of the practice of medicine and the application of technology, and although there are multiple opportunities, there are formidable challenges that need to be overcome as it relates to the real world and the scale of implementation of such innovation. A key to delivering this vision will be an expansion of translational research in the field of healthcare applications of artificial intelligence. Alongside this, we need investment into the upskilling of a healthcare workforce and future leaders that are digitally enabled, and to understand and embrace, rather than being intimidated by, the potential of an AI-augmented healthcare system. Healthcare leaders should consider (as a minimum) these issues when planning to leverage AI for health: processes for ethical and responsible access to data: healthcare data is highly sensitive, inconsistent, siloed and not optimised for the purposes of machine learning development, evaluation, implementation and adoption access to domain expertise / prior knowledge to make sense and create some of the rules which need to be applied to the datasets (to generate the necessary insight) access to sufficient computing power to generate decisions in real time, which is being transformed exponentially with the advent of cloud computing research into implementation: critically, we must consider, explore and research issues which arise when you take the algorithm and put it in the real world, building \u2018trusted\u2019 AI algorithms embedded into appropriate workflows.

In some cases, it can exceed or augment human capabilities by providing better or faster ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] As the widespread use of AI in healthcare is still relatively new, research is ongoing into its applications across various medical subdisciplines and related industries. AI programs are being applied to practices such as diagnostics , [ 4 ] treatment protocol development, [ 5 ] drug development , [ 6 ] personalized medicine , [ 7 ] and patient monitoring and care. [ 8 ] Since radiographs are the most commonly performed imaging tests in radiology, the potential for AI to assist with triage and interpretation of radiographs is particularly significant. [ 9 ] Using AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy , automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases . [ 10 ] Furthermore, new technologies such as AI are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption. [ 11 ] In contrast, there are also several cases where AI has been put to use in healthcare without proper testing. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic. [ 16 ] Moreover, meta-studies have found that the scientific literature on AI in healthcare often suffers from a lack of reproducibility . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Applications in healthcare systems [ edit ] Disease diagnosis [ edit ] Accurate and early diagnosis of diseases is still a challenge in healthcare. Recognizing medical conditions and their symptoms is a complex problem. AI can assist clinicians with its data processing capabilities to save time and improve accuracy. [ 21 ] Through the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence can be able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the analysis of mass electronic health records (EHRs). [ 22 ] AI can help early prediction, for example, of Alzheimer's disease and dementias , by looking through large numbers of similar cases and possible treatments. [ 23 ] AI can aid doctors' decision-making in emergency cases, for example, in emergency departments. AI algorithms may assist in prioritizing critical cases, cutting down waiting times. Also, AI-backed decision support systems make recommendations instantly and enable quicker interpretation of data, which supports healthcare professionals' decisions. [ 21 ] In 2023 a study reported higher satisfaction rates with ChatGPT -generated responses compared with those from physicians for medical questions posted on Reddit \u2019s r/AskDocs. [ 24 ] Evaluators preferred ChatGPT's responses to physician responses in 78.6% of 585 evaluations, noting better quality and empathy. The authors noted that these were isolated questions taken from an online forum, not in the context of an established patient-physician relationship. [ 24 ] Moreover, responses were not graded on the accuracy of medical information, and some have argued that the experiment was not properly blinded , with the evaluators being coauthors of the study. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Recent developments in statistical physics , machine learning , and inference algorithms are also being explored for their potential in improving medical diagnostic approaches. [ 28 ] Also, the establishment of large healthcare-related data warehouses of sometimes hundreds of millions of patients provides extensive training data for AI models. [ 29 ] Electronic health records [ edit ] Electronic health records (EHR) are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. Now that around 80% of medical practices use EHR, some anticipate the use of artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians. [ 30 ] One application uses natural language processing (NLP) to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms. [ 30 ] For example, the term heart attack and myocardial infarction mean the same things, but physicians may use one over the other based on personal preferences. [ 30 ] NLP algorithms consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed. [ 30 ] Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician's notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read. [ 30 ] Other applications use concept processing to analyze the information entered by the current patient's doctor to present similar cases and help the physician remember to include all relevant details. [ 31 ] Beyond making content edits to an EHR, there are AI algorithms that evaluate an individual patient's record and predict a risk for a disease based on their previous information and family history. [ 32 ] One general algorithm is a rule-based system that makes decisions similarly to how humans use flow charts. [ 33 ] This system takes in large amounts of data and creates a set of rules that connect specific observations to concluded diagnoses. [ 33 ] Thus, the algorithm can take in a new patient's data and try to predict the likeliness that they will have a certain condition or disease. [ 33 ] Since the algorithms can evaluate a patient's information based on collective data, they can find any outstanding issues to bring to a physician's attention and save time. [ 32 ] One study conducted by the Centerstone research institute found that predictive modeling of EHR data has achieved 70\u201372% accuracy in predicting individualized treatment response. [ 34 ] These methods are helpful due to the fact that the amount of online health records doubles every five years. [ 32 ] Physicians do not have the bandwidth to process all this data manually, and AI can leverage this data to assist physicians in treating their patients. [ 32 ] Drug interactions [ edit ] Improvements in natural language processing led to the development of algorithms to identify drug-drug interactions in medical literature. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Drug-drug interactions pose a threat to those taking multiple medications simultaneously, and the danger increases with the number of medications being taken. [ 39 ] To address the difficulty of tracking all known or suspected drug-drug interactions, machine learning algorithms have been created to extract information on interacting drugs and their possible effects from medical literature. Efforts were consolidated in 2013 in the DDIExtraction Challenge, in which a team of researchers at Carlos III University assembled a corpus of literature on drug-drug interactions to form a standardized test for such algorithms. [ 40 ] Competitors were tested on their ability to accurately determine, from the text, which drugs were shown to interact and what the characteristics of their interactions were. [ 41 ] Researchers continue to use this corpus to standardize the measurement of the effectiveness of their algorithms. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 38 ] Other algorithms identify drug-drug interactions from patterns in user-generated content , especially electronic health records and/or adverse event reports. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Organizations such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the World Health Organization's VigiBase allow doctors to submit reports of possible negative reactions to medications. Deep learning algorithms have been developed to parse these reports and detect patterns that imply drug-drug interactions. [ 42 ] Telemedicine [ edit ] An elderly man using a pulse oximeter to measure his blood oxygen levels The increase of telemedicine , the treatment of patients remotely, has shown the rise of possible AI applications. [ 43 ] AI can assist in caring for patients remotely by monitoring their information through sensors. [ 44 ] A wearable device may allow for constant monitoring of a patient and the ability to notice changes that may be less distinguishable by humans. The information can be compared to other data that has already been collected using artificial intelligence algorithms that alert physicians if there are any issues to be aware of. [ 44 ] Another application of artificial intelligence is chat-bot therapy. Some researchers charge that the reliance on chatbots for mental healthcare does not offer the reciprocity and accountability of care that should exist in the relationship between the consumer of mental healthcare and the care provider (be it a chat-bot or psychologist), though. [ 45 ] Some examples of these chatbots include Woebot, Earkick and Wysa. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Since the average age has risen due to a longer life expectancy, artificial intelligence could be useful in helping take care of older populations. [ 49 ] Tools such as environment and personal sensors can identify a person's regular activities and alert a caretaker if a behavior or a measured vital is abnormal. [ 49 ] Although the technology is useful, there are also discussions about limitations of monitoring in order to respect a person's privacy since there are technologies that are designed to map out home layouts and detect human interactions. [ 49 ] Workload management [ edit ] AI has the potential to streamline care coordination and reduce the workload. AI algorithms can automate administrative tasks, prioritize patient needs and facilitate seamless communication in a healthcare team. [ 50 ] This enables healthcare providers to focus more on direct patient care and ensures the efficient and coordinated delivery of healthcare services. Clinical applications [ edit ] Cardiovascular [ edit ] Artificial intelligence algorithms have shown promising results in accurately diagnosing and risk stratifying patients with concern for coronary artery disease, showing potential as an initial triage tool. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Other algorithms have been used in predicting patient mortality, medication effects, and adverse events following treatment for acute coronary syndrome . [ 51 ] Wearables, smartphones, and internet-based technologies have also shown the ability to monitor patients' cardiac data points, expanding the amount of data and the various settings AI models can use and potentially enabling earlier detection of cardiac events occurring outside of the hospital. [ 53 ] A research in 2019 found that AI can be used to predict heart attack with up to 90% accuracy. [ 54 ] Another growing area of research is the utility of AI in classifying heart sounds and diagnosing valvular disease . [ 55 ] Challenges of AI in cardiovascular medicine have included the limited data available to train machine learning models, such as limited data on social determinants of health as they pertain to cardiovascular disease . [ 56 ] A key limitation in early studies evaluating AI were omissions of data comparing algorithmic performance to humans. Examples of studies which assess AI performance relative to physicians includes how AI is non-inferior to humans in interpretation of cardiac echocardiograms [ 57 ] and that AI can diagnose heart attack better than human physicians in the emergency setting, reducing both low-value testing and missed diagnoses. [ 58 ] In cardiovascular tissue engineering and organoid studies, AI is increasingly used to analyze microscopy images, and integrate electrophysiological read outs. [ 59 ] Dermatology [ edit ] Medical imaging (such as X-ray and photography) is a commonly used tool in dermatology [ 60 ] and the development of deep learning has been strongly tied to image\u00a0processing . Therefore, there is a natural fit between the dermatology and deep learning. Machine learning learning holds great potential to process these images for better diagnoses. [ 61 ] Han et al. showed keratinocytic skin cancer detection from face photographs. [ 62 ] Esteva et al. demonstrated dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer from lesion images. [ 63 ] Noyan et al. demonstrated a convolutional neural network that achieved 94% accuracy at identifying skin cells from microscopic Tzanck smear images. [ 64 ] A concern raised with this work is that it has not engaged with disparities related to skin color or differential treatment of patients with non-white skin tones. [ 65 ] According to some researchers, AI algorithms have been shown to be more effective than dermatologists at identifying cancer. [ 66 ] However, a 2021 review article found that a majority of papers analyzing the performance of AI algorithms designed for skin cancer classification failed to use external test sets. [ 67 ] Only four research studies were found in which the AI algorithms were tested on clinics, regions, or populations distinct from those it was trained on, and in each of those four studies, the performance of dermatologists was found to be on par with that of the algorithm. Moreover, only one study [ 68 ] was set in the context of a full clinical examination; others were based on interaction through web-apps or online questionnaires, with most based entirely on context-free images of lesions. In this study, it was found that dermatologists significantly outperformed the algorithms. Many articles claiming superior performance of AI algorithms also fail to distinguish between trainees and board-certified dermatologists in their analyses. [ 67 ] It has also been suggested that AI could be used to automatically evaluate the outcome of maxillo-facial surgery or cleft palate therapy in regard to facial attractiveness or age appearance. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Gastroenterology [ edit ] AI can play a role in various facets of the field of gastroenterology . Endoscopic exams such as esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD) and colonoscopies rely on rapid detection of abnormal tissue. By enhancing these endoscopic procedures with AI, clinicians can more rapidly identify diseases, determine their severity, and visualize blind spots. Early trials in using AI detection systems of early stomach cancer have shown sensitivity close to expert endoscopists. [ 71 ] AI can assist doctors treating ulcerative colitis in detecting the microscopic activity of the disease in people and predicting when flare-ups will happen. For example, an AI-powered tool  was developed to analyse digitised bowel samples ( biopsies ). The tool was able to distinguish with 80% accuracy between samples that show remission of colitis and those with active disease. It also predicted the risk of a flare-up happening with the same accuracy. These rates of successfully using microscopic disease activity to predict disease flare are similar to the accuracy of pathologists . [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Obstetrics and gynaecology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence utilises massive amounts of data to help with predicting illness, prevention, and diagnosis, as well as patient monitoring. In obstetrics, artificial intelligence is utilized in magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and foetal cardiotocography. AI contributes in the resolution of a variety of obstetrical diagnostic issues. [ 74 ] Infectious diseases [ edit ] AI has shown potential in both the laboratory and clinical spheres of infectious disease medicine. [ 75 ] During the COVID-19 pandemic , AI has been used for early detection, tracking virus spread and analysing virus behaviour, among other things. [ 76 ] However, there were only a few examples of AI being used directly in clinical practice during the pandemic itself. [ 77 ] Other applications  of AI around infectious diseases include support-vector machines identifying antimicrobial resistance , machine learning analysis of blood smears to detect malaria , and improved point-of-care testing of Lyme disease based on antigen detection. Additionally, AI has been investigated for improving diagnosis of meningitis , sepsis , and tuberculosis , as well as predicting treatment complications in hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients. [ 75 ] Musculoskeletal [ edit ] AI has been used to identify causes of knee pain that doctors miss, that disproportionately affect Black patients. [ 78 ] Underserved populations experience higher levels of pain. These disparities persist even after controlling for the objective severity of diseases like osteoarthritis, as graded by human physicians using medical images, raising the possibility that underserved patients\u2019 pain stems from factors external to the knee, such as stress. Researchers have conducted a study using a machine-learning algorithm to show that standard radiographic measures of severity overlook objective but undiagnosed features that disproportionately affect diagnosis and management of underserved populations with knee pain. They proposed that new algorithmic measure ALG-P could potentially enable expanded access to treatments for underserved patients. [ 79 ] Neurology [ edit ] The use of AI technologies has been explored for use in the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For diagnostic purposes, machine learning models have been developed that rely on structural MRI inputs. [ 80 ] The input datasets for these models are drawn from databases such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. [ 81 ] Researchers have developed models that rely on convolutional neural networks with the aim of improving early diagnostic accuracy. [ 82 ] Generative adversarial networks are a form of deep learning that have also performed well in diagnosing AD. [ 83 ] There have also been efforts to develop machine learning models into forecasting tools that can predict the prognosis of patients with AD. Forecasting patient outcomes through generative models has been proposed by researchers as a means of synthesizing training and validation sets. [ 84 ] They suggest that generated patient forecasts could be used to provide future models larger training datasets than current open access databases. Oncology [ edit ] AI has been explored for use in cancer diagnosis, risk stratification, molecular characterization of tumors, and cancer drug discovery. A particular challenge in oncologic care that AI is being developed to address is the ability to accurately predict which treatment protocols will be best suited for each patient based on their individual genetic, molecular, and tumor-based characteristics. [ 85 ] AI has been trialed in cancer diagnostics with the reading of imaging studies and pathology slides. [ 86 ] In January 2020, Google DeepMind announced an algorithm capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer detection in screening scans. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] A number of researchers, including Trevor Hastie , Joelle Pineau , and Robert Tibshirani among others, published a reply claiming that DeepMind's research publication in Nature lacked key details on methodology and code, \"effectively undermin[ing] its scientific value\" and making it impossible for the scientific community to confirm the work. [ 89 ] In the MIT Technology Review , author Benjamin Haibe-Kains characterized DeepMind's work as \"an advertisement\" having little to do with science. [ 90 ] In July 2020, it was reported that an AI algorithm developed by the University of Pittsburgh achieves the highest accuracy to date in identifying prostate cancer , with 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] In 2023 a study reported the use of AI for CT -based radiomics classification at grading the aggressiveness of retroperitoneal sarcoma with 82% accuracy compared with 44% for lab analysis of biopsies. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Ophthalmology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence-enhanced technology is being used as an aid in the screening of eye disease and prevention of blindness. [ 95 ] In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the marketing of the first medical device to diagnose a specific type of eye disease, diabetic retinopathy using an artificial intelligence algorithm. [ 96 ] Moreover, AI technology may be used to further improve \"diagnosis rates\" because of the potential to decrease detection time. [ 97 ] Pathology [ edit ] Further information: Digital pathology Ki67 stain calculation by the open-source software QuPath in a pure seminoma, which gives a measure of the proliferation rate of the tumor. The colors represent the intensity of expression: blue-no expression, yellow-low, orange-moderate, and red-high expression. [ 98 ] For many diseases, pathological analysis of cells and tissues is considered to be the gold standard of disease diagnosis. Methods of digital pathology allows microscopy slides to be scanned and digitally analyzed. AI-assisted pathology tools have been developed to assist with the diagnosis of a number of diseases, including breast cancer, hepatitis B, gastric cancer , and colorectal cancer . AI has also been used to predict genetic mutations and prognosticate disease outcomes. [ 71 ] AI is well-suited for use in low-complexity pathological analysis of large-scale screening samples, such as colorectal or breast cancer screening, thus lessening the burden on pathologists and allowing for faster turnaround of sample analysis. [ 99 ] Several deep learning and artificial neural network models have shown accuracy similar to that of human pathologists, [ 99 ] and a study of deep learning assistance in diagnosing metastatic breast cancer in lymph nodes showed that the accuracy of humans with the assistance of a deep learning program was higher than either the humans alone or the AI program alone. [ 100 ] Additionally, implementation of digital pathology is predicted to save over $12 million for a university center over the course of five years, [ 101 ] though savings attributed to AI specifically have not yet been widely researched. The use of augmented and virtual reality could prove to be a stepping stone to wider implementation of AI-assisted pathology, as they can highlight areas of concern on a pathology sample and present them in real-time to a pathologist for more efficient review. [ 99 ] AI also has the potential to identify histological findings at levels beyond what the human eye can see, [ 99 ] and has shown the ability to use genotypic and phenotypic data to more accurately detect the tumor of origin for metastatic cancer. [ 102 ] One of the major current barriers to widespread implementation of AI-assisted pathology tools is the lack of prospective, randomized, multi-center controlled trials in determining the true clinical utility of AI for pathologists and patients, highlighting a current area of need in AI and healthcare research. [ 99 ] Primary care [ edit ] Primary care has become one key development area for AI technologies. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] AI in primary care has been used for supporting decision making, predictive modeling, and business analytics. [ 105 ] There are only a few examples of AI decision support systems that were prospectively assessed on clinical efficacy when used in practice by physicians. But there are cases where the use of these systems yielded a positive effect on treatment choice by physicians. [ 106 ] As of 2022 in relation to elder care, AI robots had been helpful in guiding older residents living in assisted living with entertainment and company. These bots are allowing staff in the home to have more one-on-one time with each resident, but the bots are also programmed with more ability in what they are able to do; such as knowing different languages and different types of care depending on the patient's conditions. The bot is an AI machine, which means it goes through the same training as any other machine - using algorithms to parse the given data, learn from it and predict the outcome in relation to what situation is at hand. [ 107 ] Psychiatry [ edit ] In psychiatry, AI applications are still in a phase of proof-of-concept. [ 108 ] Areas where the evidence is widening quickly include predictive modelling of diagnosis and treatment outcomes, [ 109 ] chatbots, conversational agents that imitate human behaviour and which have been studied for anxiety and depression. [ 110 ] Challenges include the fact that many applications in the field are developed and proposed by private corporations, such as the screening for suicidal ideation implemented by Facebook in 2017. [ 111 ] Such applications outside the healthcare system raise various professional, ethical and regulatory questions. [ 112 ] Another issue is often with the validity and interpretability of the models. Small training datasets contain bias that is inherited by the models, and compromises the generalizability and stability of these models. Such models may also have the potential to be discriminatory against minority groups that are underrepresented in samples. [ 113 ] In 2023, US-based National Eating Disorders Association replaced its human helpline staff with a chatbot but had to take it offline after users reported receiving harmful advice from it. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] Radiology [ edit ] AI is being studied within the field of radiology to detect and diagnose diseases through computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. [ 117 ] It may be particularly useful in settings where demand for human expertise exceeds supply, or where data is too complex to be efficiently interpreted by human readers. [ 118 ] Several deep learning models have shown the capability to be roughly as accurate as healthcare professionals in identifying diseases through medical imaging, though few of the studies reporting these findings have been externally validated. [ 119 ] AI can also provide non-interpretive benefit to radiologists, such as reducing noise in images, creating high-quality images from lower doses of radiation, enhancing MR image quality, [ 120 ] and automatically assessing image quality. [ 121 ] Further research investigating the use of AI in nuclear medicine focuses on image reconstruction, anatomical landmarking, and the enablement of lower doses in imaging studies. [ 122 ] The analysis of images for supervised AI applications in radiology encompasses two primary techniques at present: (1) convolutional neural network-based analysis; and (2) utilization of radiomics . [ 118 ] AI is also used in breast imaging for analyzing screening mammograms and can participate in improving breast cancer detection rate [ 123 ] as well as reducing radiologist's reading workload. Pharmacy [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Artificial intelligence in pharmacy . [ edit ] This article may require copy editing for grammar, style, cohesion, tone, or spelling . You can assist by editing it . ( May 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Part of a series on Artificial intelligence (AI) Major goals Artificial general intelligence Intelligent agent Recursive self-improvement Planning Computer vision General game playing Knowledge representation Natural language processing Robotics AI safety Approaches Machine learning Symbolic Deep learning Bayesian networks Evolutionary algorithms Hybrid intelligent systems Systems integration Applications Bioinformatics Deepfake Earth sciences Finance Generative AI Art Audio Music Government Healthcare Mental health Industry Translation Military Physics Projects Philosophy Artificial consciousness Chinese room Friendly AI Control problem / Takeover Ethics Existential risk Turing test Uncanny valley History Timeline Progress AI winter AI boom Glossary Glossary v t e Artificial Intelligence (AI) [ 124 ] [ 125 ] [ 126 ] is a field of computer science in which a huge amount of data is fed to a machine learning model, which allows the machine to learn patterns from that data and is able to make smart, calculated decisions, which can only be achieved by human intelligence . Artificial intelligence is playing a crucial role in driving the application and research in many fields and pharmacy is no exception. In pharmacy, the use of AI is leading to the discovery, development, and delivery of medications , and also enhancing patient care through personalized treatment plans. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] This article is going to summarize AI's application in drug research, drug safety, dose recommendation and examine the limitations and future directions of AI in pharmacy. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Industry [ edit ] The trend of large health companies merging allows for greater health data accessibility. Greater health data lays the groundwork for the implementation of AI algorithms. A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the clinical decision support systems . As more data is collected, machine learning algorithms adapt and allow for more robust responses and solutions. [ 117 ] Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of big data in the healthcare industry. Many companies investigate the market opportunities through the realms of \"data assessment, storage, management, and analysis technologies\" which are all crucial parts of the healthcare industry. [ 131 ] With the market for AI expanding constantly, large tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Baidu all have their own AI research divisions, as well as millions of dollars allocated for acquisition of smaller AI based companies. [ 131 ] The following are examples of large companies that are contributing to AI algorithms for use in healthcare: Amazon Web Services [ 132 ] Apple [ 132 ] Google 's DeepMind platform is being used by the UK National Health Service to detect certain health risks through data collected via a mobile app. A second project with the NHS involves the analysis of medical images collected from NHS patients to develop computer vision algorithms to detect cancerous tissues. IBM's Watson Oncology is in development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Cleveland Clinic . IBM is also working with CVS Health on AI applications in chronic disease treatment and with Johnson & Johnson on analysis of scientific papers to find new connections for drug development. In May 2017, IBM and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute began a joint project entitled Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning and Semantics (HEALS) , to explore using AI technology to enhance healthcare. Intel's venture capital arm Intel Capital invested in 2016 in the startup Lumiata, which uses AI to identify at-risk patients and develop care options. [ 133 ] Meta [ 132 ] Microsoft 's Hanover project, in partnership with Oregon Health & Science University 's Knight Cancer Institute, analyzes medical research to predict the most effective cancer drug treatment options for patients. Other projects include medical image analysis of tumor progression and the development of programmable cells. [ 134 ] Neuralink has come up with a next-generation neuroprosthetic which intricately interfaces with thousands of neural pathways in the brain. [ 117 ] Their process allows a chip, roughly the size of a quarter, to be inserted in the place of a chunk of a skull by a precision surgical robot to avoid accidental injury . [ 117 ] Elon Musk premiering the surgical robot that implants the Neuralink brain chip Ava Industries Ltd., a Canadian healthcare technology firm, is developing integrated AI tools to support clinical efficiency. Ava has implemented an embedded AI medical scribe within theis electronic medical record system (EMR) and is further developing tools such as an AI chart summarizer and an AI document classifier. [1] The company has received support through grants from Canada Health Infowayfor its work in advancing digital health solutions. [2] Tencent is working on several medical systems and services. These include AI Medical Innovation System (AIMIS) , an AI-powered diagnostic medical imaging service; WeChat Intelligent Healthcare; and Tencent Doctorwork Digital consultant apps use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user's medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution[ buzzword ] to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user (e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus) and value capturing mechanisms (e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders). IFlytek launched a service robot \"Xiao Man\", which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas. [ citation needed ] It also works in the field of medical imaging. Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH (\"Cruzr\") and Softbank Robotics (\"Pepper\"). [ citation needed ] The Indian startup Haptik developed a WhatsApp chatbot in 2021 which answers questions associated with the deadly coronavirus in India . Similarly, a software platform ChatBot in partnership with medtech startup Infermedica launched COVID-19 Risk Assessment ChatBot. [ 135 ] Many automobile manufacturers are beginning to use machine learning healthcare in their cars as well. [ 131 ] Companies such as BMW , GE , Tesla , Toyota , and Volvo all have new research campaigns to find ways of learning a driver's vital statistics to ensure they are awake, paying attention to the road, and not under the influence of substances. [ 131 ] Expanding care to developing nations [ edit ] Artificial intelligence continues to expand in its abilities to diagnose more people accurately in nations where fewer doctors are accessible to the public.\u00a0 Many new technology companies such as SpaceX and the Raspberry Pi Foundation have enabled more developing countries to have access to computers and the internet than ever before. [ 136 ] With the increasing capabilities of AI over the internet, advanced machine learning algorithms can allow patients to get accurately diagnosed when they would previously have no way of knowing if they had a life-threatening disease or not. [ 136 ] Using AI in developing nations that do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can improve patient care. AI can allow for not only diagnosis of patient in areas where healthcare is scarce, but also allow for a good patient experience by resourcing files to find the best treatment for a patient. [ 137 ] The ability of AI to adjust course as it goes also allows the patient to have their treatment modified based on what works for them; a level of individualized care that is nearly non-existent in developing countries. [ 137 ] Regulation [ edit ] This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( May 2025 ) Challenges of the clinical use of AI have brought about a potential need for regulations . AI studies need to be completely and transparently reported to have value to inform regulatory approval. Depending on the phase of study, international consensus-based reporting guidelines (TRIPOD+AI, [ 138 ] DECIDE-AI, [ 139 ] CONSORT-AI [ 140 ] ) have been developed to provide recommendations on the key details that need to be reported. A man speaking at the GDPR compliance workshop at the 2019 Entrepreneurship Summit While regulations exist pertaining to the collection of patient data such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the US ( HIPAA ) and the European General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) pertaining to patients within the EU, health care AI is \u201c\"severely under-regulated worldwide\" as of 2025. [ 132 ] Unclear is whether healthcare AI can be classified merely as software or as medical device . [ 132 ] United Nations (WHO/ITU) [ edit ] The joint ITU - WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H) has built a platform - known as the ITU-WHO AI for Health Framework - for the testing and benchmarking of AI applications in health domain. As of November 2018, eight use cases are being benchmarked, including assessing breast cancer risk from histopathological imagery, guiding anti-venom selection from snake images, and diagnosing skin lesions. USA [ edit ] United States Food & Drug Administration [ 141 ] In 2015, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued rules and regulations to protect the privacy of individuals\u2019 health information,  requiring healthcare providers to follow certain privacy rules when using AI, to keep a record of how they use AI and to ensure that their AI systems are secure. [ 142 ] In May 2016, the White House announced its plan to host a series of workshops and formation of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. [ citation needed ] In October 2016, the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, outlining its proposed priorities for Federally-funded AI research and development (within government and academia). The report notes a strategic R&D plan for the subfield of health information technology was in development stages. [ citation needed ] In January 2021, the US FDA published a new Action Plan, entitled Artificial Intelligence (AI) /Machine Learning (ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) Action Plan. [ 143 ] It layed out the FDA's future plans for regulation of medical devices that would include artificial intelligence in their software with five main actions: 1. Tailored Regulatory Framework for Ai/M:-based SaMD, 2. Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP), 3. Patient-Centered Approach Incorporating Transparency to Users, 4. Regulatory Science Methods Related to Algorithm Bias & Robustness, and 5. Real-World Performance(RWP). This plan was in direct response to stakeholders' feedback on a 2019 discussion paper also published by the FDA. [ 143 ] Under President Biden the DHSS and the National Institute of Standards and Technology were instructed to develop regulation of healthcare AI. [ 132 ] According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , the OCR issued guidance on the ethical use of AI in healthcare in 2021. It outlined four core ethical principles that must be followed: respect for autonomy , beneficence (ethics) , non-maleficence , and justice. Respect for autonomy requires that individuals have control over their own data and decisions. Beneficence requires that AI be used to do good, such as improving the quality of care and reducing health disparities. Non-maleficence requires that AI be used to do no harm, such as avoiding discrimination in decisions. Finally, justice requires that AI be used fairly, such as using the same standards for decisions no matter a person's race, gender, or income level. As of March 2021, the OCR had hired a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (OCAIO) to pursue the \"implementation of the HHS AI strategy\". [ 144 ] With the second Trump administration deregulation of health AI began on January 20, 2025 with merely voluntary standards for collecting and sharing data, statutory definitions for algorithmic discrimination, automation bias, and equity being cancelled, cuts to NIST and 19% of FDA workforce eliminated. [ 132 ] Europe [ edit ] Other countries have implemented data protection regulations, more specifically with company privacy invasions. In Denmark, the Danish Expert Group on data ethics has adopted recommendations on 'Data for the Benefit of the People'. These recommendations are intended to encourage the responsible use of data in the business sector, with a focus on data processing. The recommendations include a focus on equality and non-discrimination with regard to bias in AI, as well as human dignity which is to outweigh profit and must be respected in all data processes. [ 145 ] The European Union has implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect citizens' personal data, which applies to the use of AI in healthcare. In addition, the European Commission has established guidelines to ensure the ethical development of AI, including the use of algorithms to ensure fairness and transparency. [ 146 ] With GDPR, the European Union was the first to regulate AI through data protection legislation. The Union finds privacy as a fundamental human right, it wants to prevent unconsented and secondary uses of data by private or public health facilities. By streamlining access to personal data for health research and findings, they are able to instate the right and importance of patient privacy. [ 146 ] In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires organizations to protect the privacy and security of patient information. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have also released guidelines for the development of AI-based medical applications. [ 147 ] In 2025, Europe was leading the USA on AI regulation, while lagging in innovation and at least one California-based biotech company was \"engaging the European Medicines Agency earlier in development than previously anticipated to mitigate concerns about the FDA's ability to meet development timelines.\" [ 132 ] Ethical concerns [ edit ] While research on the use of AI in healthcare aims to validate its efficacy in improving patient outcomes before its broader adoption, its use may introduce several new types of risk to patients and healthcare providers, such as algorithmic bias , Do not resuscitate implications, and other machine morality issues. AI may also compromise the protection of patients' rights, such as the right to informed consent and the right to medical data protection. [ 148 ] Data collection, privacy - autonomy [ edit ] In order to effectively train Machine Learning and use AI in healthcare, massive amounts of data must be gathered. Acquiring this data, however, comes at the cost of patient privacy , i.e. autonomy in most cases and is not well received publicly. For example, a survey conducted in the UK estimated that 63% of the population is uncomfortable with sharing their personal data in order to improve artificial intelligence technology. [ 149 ] The scarcity of real, accessible patient data is a hindrance that deters the progress of developing and deploying more artificial intelligence in healthcare. The lack of regulations surrounding AI in the United States has generated concerns about mismanagement of patient data, such as with corporations utilizing patient data for financial gain. For example, as of 2020 Roche , a Swiss healthcare company, was found to have purchased healthcare data for approximately 2 million cancer patients at an estimated total cost of $1.9 billion. [ 150 ] Naturally, this generates questions of ethical concern; Is there a monetary price that can be set for data, and should it depend on its perceived value or contributions to science? Is it fair to patients to sell their data? These concerns were addressed in a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2022 that asked Americans for their opinions about the increased presence of AI in their daily lives, and the survey estimated that 37% of Americans were more concerned than excited about such increased presence, with 8% of participants specifically associating their concern with \"people misusing AI\". [ 151 ] Ultimately, the current potential of artificial intelligence in healthcare is additionally hindered by  concerns about mismanagement of data collected, especially in the United States. Automation- beneficence [ edit ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic , or fulfill beneficence . [ 16 ] According to a 2019 study, AI can replace up to 35% of jobs in the UK within the next 10 to 20 years. [ 152 ] However, of these jobs, it was concluded that AI has not eliminated any healthcare jobs so far. Though if AI were to automate healthcare-related jobs, the jobs most susceptible to automation would be those dealing with digital information, radiology, and pathology, as opposed to those dealing with doctor-to-patient interaction. [ 152 ] Ouutputs can be incorrect or incomplete and diagnosis and recommendations harm people. [ 132 ] Bias, discrimination [ edit ] Since AI makes decisions solely on the data it receives as input, it is important that this data represents accurate patient demographics. In a hospital setting, patients do not have full knowledge of how predictive algorithms are created or calibrated. Therefore, these medical establishments can unfairly code their algorithms to discriminate against minorities and prioritize profits rather than providing optimal care, i.e. violating the ethical principle of social justice or non-maleficence . [ 153 ] A recent scoping review identified 18 equity challenges along with 15 strategies that can be implemented to help address them when AI applications are developed using many-to-many mapping. [ 154 ] There can be unintended bias in algorithms that can exacerbate social and healthcare inequities. [ 153 ] Since AI's decisions are a direct reflection of its input data, the data it receives must have accurate representation of patient demographics. For instance, if populations are less represented in healthcare data it is likely to create bias in AI tools that lead to incorrect assumptions of a demographic and impact the ability to provide appropriate care. [ 155 ] White males are overly represented in medical data sets. [ 156 ] Therefore, having minimal patient data on minorities can lead to AI making more accurate predictions for majority populations, leading to unintended worse medical outcomes for minority populations. [ 157 ] Collecting data from minority communities can also lead to medical discrimination. For instance, HIV is a prevalent virus among minority communities and HIV status can be used to discriminate against patients. [ 156 ] In addition to biases that may arise from sample selection, different clinical systems used to collect data may also impact AI functionality. For example, radiographic systems and their outcomes (e.g., resolution) vary by provider. Moreover, clinician work practices, such as the positioning of the patient for radiography, can also greatly influence the data and make comparability difficult. [ 158 ] However, these biases are able to be eliminated through careful implementation and a methodical collection of representative data. A final source of algorithmic bias , which has been called \"label choice bias\", arises when proxy measures are used to train algorithms, that build in bias against certain groups. For example, a widely used algorithm predicted health care costs as a proxy for health care needs, and used predictions to allocate resources to help patients with complex health needs. This introduced bias because Black patients have lower costs, even when they are just as unhealthy as White patients. [ 159 ] Solutions to the \"label choice bias\" aim to match the actual target (what the algorithm is predicting) more closely to the ideal target (what researchers want the algorithm to predict), so for the prior example, instead of predicting cost, researchers would focus on the variable of healthcare needs which is rather more significant. Adjusting the target led to almost double the number of Black patients being selected for the program. History [ edit ] Research in the 1960s and 1970s produced the first problem-solving program, or expert system , known as Dendral . [ 160 ] [ 161 ] While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry, it provided the basis for a subsequent system MYCIN , [ 162 ] considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine. [ 162 ] [ 163 ] MYCIN and other systems such as INTERNIST-1 and CASNET did not achieve routine use by practitioners, however. [ 164 ] The 1980s and 1990s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity. During this time, there was a recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physicians. [ 165 ] Approaches involving fuzzy set theory, [ 166 ] Bayesian networks , [ 167 ] and artificial neural networks , [ 168 ] [ 169 ] have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare. Medical and technological advancements occurring over this half-century period that have enabled the growth of healthcare-related applications of AI to include: Improvements in computing power resulting in faster data collection and data processing [ 170 ] Growth of genomic sequencing databases [ 171 ] Widespread implementation of electronic health record systems [ 172 ] Improvements in natural language processing and computer vision , enabling machines to replicate human perceptual processes [ 173 ] [ 174 ] Enhanced the precision of robot-assisted surgery [ 175 ] Increased tree-based machine learning models that allow flexibility in establishing health predictors [ 176 ] Improvements in deep learning techniques and data logs for rare diseases See also [ edit ] AI alignment Artificial intelligence in mental health Artificial intelligence Glossary of artificial intelligence Full body scanner (i.e. Dermascanner , ...)

      "content": "# Comprehensive Guide to AI in Healthcare\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across various sectors, with healthcare standing out as one of the most promising fields for its application. As a rapidly evolving technology, AI in healthcare offers innovative solutions that enhance diagnostic accuracy, optimize treatment plans, and improve patient outcomes. This comprehensive guide delves into the multifaceted applications of AI in healthcare, exploring its benefits, challenges, and future potential.\n\n## The Evolution of AI in Healthcare\n\nAI's journey in healthcare began with the integration of basic machine learning algorithms, primarily used for data management and administrative functions. Over the years, advancements in computational power and big data analytics have propelled AI into more complex and critical applications. Today, AI encompasses a wide range of technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision, all of which contribute to various aspects of healthcare delivery.\n\n## Key Applications of AI in Healthcare\n\n### 1. Diagnostic Accuracy and Imaging\n\nAI's ability to analyze vast amounts of data quickly and accurately has revolutionized diagnostic processes. In medical imaging, AI algorithms can enhance image quality, detect anomalies, and assist radiologists in identifying patterns indicative of diseases. For instance, AI tools are now capable of identifying early signs of cancer in mammograms with greater precision than traditional methods.\n\n### 2. Personalized Medicine\n\nThe concept of personalized medicine involves tailoring medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient. AI facilitates this by analyzing genetic, environmental, and lifestyle data to predict disease risk and response to treatments. Machine learning algorithms can identify patterns and correlations within this data, enabling more precise and personalized treatment plans.\n\n### 3. Predictive Analytics\n\nPredictive analytics powered by AI enable healthcare providers to anticipate patient needs and outcomes. By analyzing historical data and recognizing trends, AI models can predict disease outbreaks, patient admissions, and even the progression of chronic conditions.

In some cases, it can exceed or augment human capabilities by providing better or faster ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] As the widespread use of AI in healthcare is still relatively new, research is ongoing into its applications across various medical subdisciplines and related industries. AI programs are being applied to practices such as diagnostics , [ 4 ] treatment protocol development, [ 5 ] drug development , [ 6 ] personalized medicine , [ 7 ] and patient monitoring and care. [ 8 ] Since radiographs are the most commonly performed imaging tests in radiology, the potential for AI to assist with triage and interpretation of radiographs is particularly significant. [ 9 ] Using AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy , automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases . [ 10 ] Furthermore, new technologies such as AI are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption. [ 11 ] In contrast, there are also several cases where AI has been put to use in healthcare without proper testing. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic. [ 16 ] Moreover, meta-studies have found that the scientific literature on AI in healthcare often suffers from a lack of reproducibility . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Applications in healthcare systems [ edit ] Disease diagnosis [ edit ] Accurate and early diagnosis of diseases is still a challenge in healthcare. Recognizing medical conditions and their symptoms is a complex problem. AI can assist clinicians with its data processing capabilities to save time and improve accuracy. [ 21 ] Through the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence can be able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the analysis of mass electronic health records (EHRs). [ 22 ] AI can help early prediction, for example, of Alzheimer's disease and dementias , by looking through large numbers of similar cases and possible treatments. [ 23 ] AI can aid doctors' decision-making in emergency cases, for example, in emergency departments. AI algorithms may assist in prioritizing critical cases, cutting down waiting times. Also, AI-backed decision support systems make recommendations instantly and enable quicker interpretation of data, which supports healthcare professionals' decisions. [ 21 ] In 2023 a study reported higher satisfaction rates with ChatGPT -generated responses compared with those from physicians for medical questions posted on Reddit \u2019s r/AskDocs. [ 24 ] Evaluators preferred ChatGPT's responses to physician responses in 78.6% of 585 evaluations, noting better quality and empathy. The authors noted that these were isolated questions taken from an online forum, not in the context of an established patient-physician relationship. [ 24 ] Moreover, responses were not graded on the accuracy of medical information, and some have argued that the experiment was not properly blinded , with the evaluators being coauthors of the study. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Recent developments in statistical physics , machine learning , and inference algorithms are also being explored for their potential in improving medical diagnostic approaches. [ 28 ] Also, the establishment of large healthcare-related data warehouses of sometimes hundreds of millions of patients provides extensive training data for AI models. [ 29 ] Electronic health records [ edit ] Electronic health records (EHR) are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. Now that around 80% of medical practices use EHR, some anticipate the use of artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians. [ 30 ] One application uses natural language processing (NLP) to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms. [ 30 ] For example, the term heart attack and myocardial infarction mean the same things, but physicians may use one over the other based on personal preferences. [ 30 ] NLP algorithms consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed. [ 30 ] Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician's notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read. [ 30 ] Other applications use concept processing to analyze the information entered by the current patient's doctor to present similar cases and help the physician remember to include all relevant details. [ 31 ] Beyond making content edits to an EHR, there are AI algorithms that evaluate an individual patient's record and predict a risk for a disease based on their previous information and family history. [ 32 ] One general algorithm is a rule-based system that makes decisions similarly to how humans use flow charts. [ 33 ] This system takes in large amounts of data and creates a set of rules that connect specific observations to concluded diagnoses. [ 33 ] Thus, the algorithm can take in a new patient's data and try to predict the likeliness that they will have a certain condition or disease. [ 33 ] Since the algorithms can evaluate a patient's information based on collective data, they can find any outstanding issues to bring to a physician's attention and save time. [ 32 ] One study conducted by the Centerstone research institute found that predictive modeling of EHR data has achieved 70\u201372% accuracy in predicting individualized treatment response. [ 34 ] These methods are helpful due to the fact that the amount of online health records doubles every five years. [ 32 ] Physicians do not have the bandwidth to process all this data manually, and AI can leverage this data to assist physicians in treating their patients. [ 32 ] Drug interactions [ edit ] Improvements in natural language processing led to the development of algorithms to identify drug-drug interactions in medical literature. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Drug-drug interactions pose a threat to those taking multiple medications simultaneously, and the danger increases with the number of medications being taken. [ 39 ] To address the difficulty of tracking all known or suspected drug-drug interactions, machine learning algorithms have been created to extract information on interacting drugs and their possible effects from medical literature. Efforts were consolidated in 2013 in the DDIExtraction Challenge, in which a team of researchers at Carlos III University assembled a corpus of literature on drug-drug interactions to form a standardized test for such algorithms. [ 40 ] Competitors were tested on their ability to accurately determine, from the text, which drugs were shown to interact and what the characteristics of their interactions were. [ 41 ] Researchers continue to use this corpus to standardize the measurement of the effectiveness of their algorithms. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 38 ] Other algorithms identify drug-drug interactions from patterns in user-generated content , especially electronic health records and/or adverse event reports. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Organizations such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the World Health Organization's VigiBase allow doctors to submit reports of possible negative reactions to medications. Deep learning algorithms have been developed to parse these reports and detect patterns that imply drug-drug interactions. [ 42 ] Telemedicine [ edit ] An elderly man using a pulse oximeter to measure his blood oxygen levels The increase of telemedicine , the treatment of patients remotely, has shown the rise of possible AI applications. [ 43 ] AI can assist in caring for patients remotely by monitoring their information through sensors. [ 44 ] A wearable device may allow for constant monitoring of a patient and the ability to notice changes that may be less distinguishable by humans. The information can be compared to other data that has already been collected using artificial intelligence algorithms that alert physicians if there are any issues to be aware of. [ 44 ] Another application of artificial intelligence is chat-bot therapy. Some researchers charge that the reliance on chatbots for mental healthcare does not offer the reciprocity and accountability of care that should exist in the relationship between the consumer of mental healthcare and the care provider (be it a chat-bot or psychologist), though. [ 45 ] Some examples of these chatbots include Woebot, Earkick and Wysa. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Since the average age has risen due to a longer life expectancy, artificial intelligence could be useful in helping take care of older populations. [ 49 ] Tools such as environment and personal sensors can identify a person's regular activities and alert a caretaker if a behavior or a measured vital is abnormal. [ 49 ] Although the technology is useful, there are also discussions about limitations of monitoring in order to respect a person's privacy since there are technologies that are designed to map out home layouts and detect human interactions. [ 49 ] Workload management [ edit ] AI has the potential to streamline care coordination and reduce the workload. AI algorithms can automate administrative tasks, prioritize patient needs and facilitate seamless communication in a healthcare team. [ 50 ] This enables healthcare providers to focus more on direct patient care and ensures the efficient and coordinated delivery of healthcare services. Clinical applications [ edit ] Cardiovascular [ edit ] Artificial intelligence algorithms have shown promising results in accurately diagnosing and risk stratifying patients with concern for coronary artery disease, showing potential as an initial triage tool. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Other algorithms have been used in predicting patient mortality, medication effects, and adverse events following treatment for acute coronary syndrome . [ 51 ] Wearables, smartphones, and internet-based technologies have also shown the ability to monitor patients' cardiac data points, expanding the amount of data and the various settings AI models can use and potentially enabling earlier detection of cardiac events occurring outside of the hospital. [ 53 ] A research in 2019 found that AI can be used to predict heart attack with up to 90% accuracy. [ 54 ] Another growing area of research is the utility of AI in classifying heart sounds and diagnosing valvular disease . [ 55 ] Challenges of AI in cardiovascular medicine have included the limited data available to train machine learning models, such as limited data on social determinants of health as they pertain to cardiovascular disease . [ 56 ] A key limitation in early studies evaluating AI were omissions of data comparing algorithmic performance to humans. Examples of studies which assess AI performance relative to physicians includes how AI is non-inferior to humans in interpretation of cardiac echocardiograms [ 57 ] and that AI can diagnose heart attack better than human physicians in the emergency setting, reducing both low-value testing and missed diagnoses. [ 58 ] In cardiovascular tissue engineering and organoid studies, AI is increasingly used to analyze microscopy images, and integrate electrophysiological read outs. [ 59 ] Dermatology [ edit ] Medical imaging (such as X-ray and photography) is a commonly used tool in dermatology [ 60 ] and the development of deep learning has been strongly tied to image\u00a0processing . Therefore, there is a natural fit between the dermatology and deep learning. Machine learning learning holds great potential to process these images for better diagnoses. [ 61 ] Han et al. showed keratinocytic skin cancer detection from face photographs. [ 62 ] Esteva et al. demonstrated dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer from lesion images. [ 63 ] Noyan et al. demonstrated a convolutional neural network that achieved 94% accuracy at identifying skin cells from microscopic Tzanck smear images. [ 64 ] A concern raised with this work is that it has not engaged with disparities related to skin color or differential treatment of patients with non-white skin tones. [ 65 ] According to some researchers, AI algorithms have been shown to be more effective than dermatologists at identifying cancer. [ 66 ] However, a 2021 review article found that a majority of papers analyzing the performance of AI algorithms designed for skin cancer classification failed to use external test sets. [ 67 ] Only four research studies were found in which the AI algorithms were tested on clinics, regions, or populations distinct from those it was trained on, and in each of those four studies, the performance of dermatologists was found to be on par with that of the algorithm. Moreover, only one study [ 68 ] was set in the context of a full clinical examination; others were based on interaction through web-apps or online questionnaires, with most based entirely on context-free images of lesions. In this study, it was found that dermatologists significantly outperformed the algorithms. Many articles claiming superior performance of AI algorithms also fail to distinguish between trainees and board-certified dermatologists in their analyses. [ 67 ] It has also been suggested that AI could be used to automatically evaluate the outcome of maxillo-facial surgery or cleft palate therapy in regard to facial attractiveness or age appearance. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Gastroenterology [ edit ] AI can play a role in various facets of the field of gastroenterology . Endoscopic exams such as esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD) and colonoscopies rely on rapid detection of abnormal tissue. By enhancing these endoscopic procedures with AI, clinicians can more rapidly identify diseases, determine their severity, and visualize blind spots. Early trials in using AI detection systems of early stomach cancer have shown sensitivity close to expert endoscopists. [ 71 ] AI can assist doctors treating ulcerative colitis in detecting the microscopic activity of the disease in people and predicting when flare-ups will happen. For example, an AI-powered tool  was developed to analyse digitised bowel samples ( biopsies ). The tool was able to distinguish with 80% accuracy between samples that show remission of colitis and those with active disease. It also predicted the risk of a flare-up happening with the same accuracy. These rates of successfully using microscopic disease activity to predict disease flare are similar to the accuracy of pathologists . [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Obstetrics and gynaecology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence utilises massive amounts of data to help with predicting illness, prevention, and diagnosis, as well as patient monitoring. In obstetrics, artificial intelligence is utilized in magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and foetal cardiotocography. AI contributes in the resolution of a variety of obstetrical diagnostic issues. [ 74 ] Infectious diseases [ edit ] AI has shown potential in both the laboratory and clinical spheres of infectious disease medicine. [ 75 ] During the COVID-19 pandemic , AI has been used for early detection, tracking virus spread and analysing virus behaviour, among other things. [ 76 ] However, there were only a few examples of AI being used directly in clinical practice during the pandemic itself. [ 77 ] Other applications  of AI around infectious diseases include support-vector machines identifying antimicrobial resistance , machine learning analysis of blood smears to detect malaria , and improved point-of-care testing of Lyme disease based on antigen detection. Additionally, AI has been investigated for improving diagnosis of meningitis , sepsis , and tuberculosis , as well as predicting treatment complications in hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients. [ 75 ] Musculoskeletal [ edit ] AI has been used to identify causes of knee pain that doctors miss, that disproportionately affect Black patients. [ 78 ] Underserved populations experience higher levels of pain. These disparities persist even after controlling for the objective severity of diseases like osteoarthritis, as graded by human physicians using medical images, raising the possibility that underserved patients\u2019 pain stems from factors external to the knee, such as stress. Researchers have conducted a study using a machine-learning algorithm to show that standard radiographic measures of severity overlook objective but undiagnosed features that disproportionately affect diagnosis and management of underserved populations with knee pain. They proposed that new algorithmic measure ALG-P could potentially enable expanded access to treatments for underserved patients. [ 79 ] Neurology [ edit ] The use of AI technologies has been explored for use in the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For diagnostic purposes, machine learning models have been developed that rely on structural MRI inputs. [ 80 ] The input datasets for these models are drawn from databases such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. [ 81 ] Researchers have developed models that rely on convolutional neural networks with the aim of improving early diagnostic accuracy. [ 82 ] Generative adversarial networks are a form of deep learning that have also performed well in diagnosing AD. [ 83 ] There have also been efforts to develop machine learning models into forecasting tools that can predict the prognosis of patients with AD. Forecasting patient outcomes through generative models has been proposed by researchers as a means of synthesizing training and validation sets. [ 84 ] They suggest that generated patient forecasts could be used to provide future models larger training datasets than current open access databases. Oncology [ edit ] AI has been explored for use in cancer diagnosis, risk stratification, molecular characterization of tumors, and cancer drug discovery. A particular challenge in oncologic care that AI is being developed to address is the ability to accurately predict which treatment protocols will be best suited for each patient based on their individual genetic, molecular, and tumor-based characteristics. [ 85 ] AI has been trialed in cancer diagnostics with the reading of imaging studies and pathology slides. [ 86 ] In January 2020, Google DeepMind announced an algorithm capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer detection in screening scans. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] A number of researchers, including Trevor Hastie , Joelle Pineau , and Robert Tibshirani among others, published a reply claiming that DeepMind's research publication in Nature lacked key details on methodology and code, \"effectively undermin[ing] its scientific value\" and making it impossible for the scientific community to confirm the work. [ 89 ] In the MIT Technology Review , author Benjamin Haibe-Kains characterized DeepMind's work as \"an advertisement\" having little to do with science. [ 90 ] In July 2020, it was reported that an AI algorithm developed by the University of Pittsburgh achieves the highest accuracy to date in identifying prostate cancer , with 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] In 2023 a study reported the use of AI for CT -based radiomics classification at grading the aggressiveness of retroperitoneal sarcoma with 82% accuracy compared with 44% for lab analysis of biopsies. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Ophthalmology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence-enhanced technology is being used as an aid in the screening of eye disease and prevention of blindness. [ 95 ] In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the marketing of the first medical device to diagnose a specific type of eye disease, diabetic retinopathy using an artificial intelligence algorithm. [ 96 ] Moreover, AI technology may be used to further improve \"diagnosis rates\" because of the potential to decrease detection time. [ 97 ] Pathology [ edit ] Further information: Digital pathology Ki67 stain calculation by the open-source software QuPath in a pure seminoma, which gives a measure of the proliferation rate of the tumor. The colors represent the intensity of expression: blue-no expression, yellow-low, orange-moderate, and red-high expression. [ 98 ] For many diseases, pathological analysis of cells and tissues is considered to be the gold standard of disease diagnosis. Methods of digital pathology allows microscopy slides to be scanned and digitally analyzed. AI-assisted pathology tools have been developed to assist with the diagnosis of a number of diseases, including breast cancer, hepatitis B, gastric cancer , and colorectal cancer . AI has also been used to predict genetic mutations and prognosticate disease outcomes. [ 71 ] AI is well-suited for use in low-complexity pathological analysis of large-scale screening samples, such as colorectal or breast cancer screening, thus lessening the burden on pathologists and allowing for faster turnaround of sample analysis. [ 99 ] Several deep learning and artificial neural network models have shown accuracy similar to that of human pathologists, [ 99 ] and a study of deep learning assistance in diagnosing metastatic breast cancer in lymph nodes showed that the accuracy of humans with the assistance of a deep learning program was higher than either the humans alone or the AI program alone. [ 100 ] Additionally, implementation of digital pathology is predicted to save over $12 million for a university center over the course of five years, [ 101 ] though savings attributed to AI specifically have not yet been widely researched. The use of augmented and virtual reality could prove to be a stepping stone to wider implementation of AI-assisted pathology, as they can highlight areas of concern on a pathology sample and present them in real-time to a pathologist for more efficient review. [ 99 ] AI also has the potential to identify histological findings at levels beyond what the human eye can see, [ 99 ] and has shown the ability to use genotypic and phenotypic data to more accurately detect the tumor of origin for metastatic cancer. [ 102 ] One of the major current barriers to widespread implementation of AI-assisted pathology tools is the lack of prospective, randomized, multi-center controlled trials in determining the true clinical utility of AI for pathologists and patients, highlighting a current area of need in AI and healthcare research. [ 99 ] Primary care [ edit ] Primary care has become one key development area for AI technologies. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] AI in primary care has been used for supporting decision making, predictive modeling, and business analytics. [ 105 ] There are only a few examples of AI decision support systems that were prospectively assessed on clinical efficacy when used in practice by physicians. But there are cases where the use of these systems yielded a positive effect on treatment choice by physicians. [ 106 ] As of 2022 in relation to elder care, AI robots had been helpful in guiding older residents living in assisted living with entertainment and company. These bots are allowing staff in the home to have more one-on-one time with each resident, but the bots are also programmed with more ability in what they are able to do; such as knowing different languages and different types of care depending on the patient's conditions. The bot is an AI machine, which means it goes through the same training as any other machine - using algorithms to parse the given data, learn from it and predict the outcome in relation to what situation is at hand. [ 107 ] Psychiatry [ edit ] In psychiatry, AI applications are still in a phase of proof-of-concept. [ 108 ] Areas where the evidence is widening quickly include predictive modelling of diagnosis and treatment outcomes, [ 109 ] chatbots, conversational agents that imitate human behaviour and which have been studied for anxiety and depression. [ 110 ] Challenges include the fact that many applications in the field are developed and proposed by private corporations, such as the screening for suicidal ideation implemented by Facebook in 2017. [ 111 ] Such applications outside the healthcare system raise various professional, ethical and regulatory questions. [ 112 ] Another issue is often with the validity and interpretability of the models. Small training datasets contain bias that is inherited by the models, and compromises the generalizability and stability of these models. Such models may also have the potential to be discriminatory against minority groups that are underrepresented in samples. [ 113 ] In 2023, US-based National Eating Disorders Association replaced its human helpline staff with a chatbot but had to take it offline after users reported receiving harmful advice from it. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] Radiology [ edit ] AI is being studied within the field of radiology to detect and diagnose diseases through computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. [ 117 ] It may be particularly useful in settings where demand for human expertise exceeds supply, or where data is too complex to be efficiently interpreted by human readers. [ 118 ] Several deep learning models have shown the capability to be roughly as accurate as healthcare professionals in identifying diseases through medical imaging, though few of the studies reporting these findings have been externally validated. [ 119 ] AI can also provide non-interpretive benefit to radiologists, such as reducing noise in images, creating high-quality images from lower doses of radiation, enhancing MR image quality, [ 120 ] and automatically assessing image quality. [ 121 ] Further research investigating the use of AI in nuclear medicine focuses on image reconstruction, anatomical landmarking, and the enablement of lower doses in imaging studies. [ 122 ] The analysis of images for supervised AI applications in radiology encompasses two primary techniques at present: (1) convolutional neural network-based analysis; and (2) utilization of radiomics . [ 118 ] AI is also used in breast imaging for analyzing screening mammograms and can participate in improving breast cancer detection rate [ 123 ] as well as reducing radiologist's reading workload. Pharmacy [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Artificial intelligence in pharmacy . [ edit ] This article may require copy editing for grammar, style, cohesion, tone, or spelling . You can assist by editing it .

Artificial intelligence is playing a crucial role in driving the application and research in many fields and pharmacy is no exception. In pharmacy, the use of AI is leading to the discovery, development, and delivery of medications , and also enhancing patient care through personalized treatment plans. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] This article is going to summarize AI's application in drug research, drug safety, dose recommendation and examine the limitations and future directions of AI in pharmacy. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Industry [ edit ] The trend of large health companies merging allows for greater health data accessibility. Greater health data lays the groundwork for the implementation of AI algorithms. A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the clinical decision support systems . As more data is collected, machine learning algorithms adapt and allow for more robust responses and solutions. [ 117 ] Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of big data in the healthcare industry. Many companies investigate the market opportunities through the realms of \"data assessment, storage, management, and analysis technologies\" which are all crucial parts of the healthcare industry. [ 131 ] With the market for AI expanding constantly, large tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Baidu all have their own AI research divisions, as well as millions of dollars allocated for acquisition of smaller AI based companies. [ 131 ] The following are examples of large companies that are contributing to AI algorithms for use in healthcare: Amazon Web Services [ 132 ] Apple [ 132 ] Google 's DeepMind platform is being used by the UK National Health Service to detect certain health risks through data collected via a mobile app. A second project with the NHS involves the analysis of medical images collected from NHS patients to develop computer vision algorithms to detect cancerous tissues. IBM's Watson Oncology is in development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Cleveland Clinic . IBM is also working with CVS Health on AI applications in chronic disease treatment and with Johnson & Johnson on analysis of scientific papers to find new connections for drug development. In May 2017, IBM and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute began a joint project entitled Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning and Semantics (HEALS) , to explore using AI technology to enhance healthcare. Intel's venture capital arm Intel Capital invested in 2016 in the startup Lumiata, which uses AI to identify at-risk patients and develop care options. [ 133 ] Meta [ 132 ] Microsoft 's Hanover project, in partnership with Oregon Health & Science University 's Knight Cancer Institute, analyzes medical research to predict the most effective cancer drug treatment options for patients. Other projects include medical image analysis of tumor progression and the development of programmable cells. [ 134 ] Neuralink has come up with a next-generation neuroprosthetic which intricately interfaces with thousands of neural pathways in the brain. [ 117 ] Their process allows a chip, roughly the size of a quarter, to be inserted in the place of a chunk of a skull by a precision surgical robot to avoid accidental injury . [ 117 ] Elon Musk premiering the surgical robot that implants the Neuralink brain chip Ava Industries Ltd., a Canadian healthcare technology firm, is developing integrated AI tools to support clinical efficiency. Ava has implemented an embedded AI medical scribe within theis electronic medical record system (EMR) and is further developing tools such as an AI chart summarizer and an AI document classifier. [1] The company has received support through grants from Canada Health Infowayfor its work in advancing digital health solutions. [2] Tencent is working on several medical systems and services. These include AI Medical Innovation System (AIMIS) , an AI-powered diagnostic medical imaging service; WeChat Intelligent Healthcare; and Tencent Doctorwork Digital consultant apps use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user's medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution[ buzzword ] to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user (e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus) and value capturing mechanisms (e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders). IFlytek launched a service robot \"Xiao Man\", which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas. [ citation needed ] It also works in the field of medical imaging. Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH (\"Cruzr\") and Softbank Robotics (\"Pepper\"). [ citation needed ] The Indian startup Haptik developed a WhatsApp chatbot in 2021 which answers questions associated with the deadly coronavirus in India . Similarly, a software platform ChatBot in partnership with medtech startup Infermedica launched COVID-19 Risk Assessment ChatBot. [ 135 ] Many automobile manufacturers are beginning to use machine learning healthcare in their cars as well. [ 131 ] Companies such as BMW , GE , Tesla , Toyota , and Volvo all have new research campaigns to find ways of learning a driver's vital statistics to ensure they are awake, paying attention to the road, and not under the influence of substances. [ 131 ] Expanding care to developing nations [ edit ] Artificial intelligence continues to expand in its abilities to diagnose more people accurately in nations where fewer doctors are accessible to the public.\u00a0 Many new technology companies such as SpaceX and the Raspberry Pi Foundation have enabled more developing countries to have access to computers and the internet than ever before. [ 136 ] With the increasing capabilities of AI over the internet, advanced machine learning algorithms can allow patients to get accurately diagnosed when they would previously have no way of knowing if they had a life-threatening disease or not. [ 136 ] Using AI in developing nations that do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can improve patient care. AI can allow for not only diagnosis of patient in areas where healthcare is scarce, but also allow for a good patient experience by resourcing files to find the best treatment for a patient. [ 137 ] The ability of AI to adjust course as it goes also allows the patient to have their treatment modified based on what works for them; a level of individualized care that is nearly non-existent in developing countries. [ 137 ] Regulation [ edit ] This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( May 2025 ) Challenges of the clinical use of AI have brought about a potential need for regulations . AI studies need to be completely and transparently reported to have value to inform regulatory approval. Depending on the phase of study, international consensus-based reporting guidelines (TRIPOD+AI, [ 138 ] DECIDE-AI, [ 139 ] CONSORT-AI [ 140 ] ) have been developed to provide recommendations on the key details that need to be reported. A man speaking at the GDPR compliance workshop at the 2019 Entrepreneurship Summit While regulations exist pertaining to the collection of patient data such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the US ( HIPAA ) and the European General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) pertaining to patients within the EU, health care AI is \u201c\"severely under-regulated worldwide\" as of 2025. [ 132 ] Unclear is whether healthcare AI can be classified merely as software or as medical device . [ 132 ] United Nations (WHO/ITU) [ edit ] The joint ITU - WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H) has built a platform - known as the ITU-WHO AI for Health Framework - for the testing and benchmarking of AI applications in health domain. As of November 2018, eight use cases are being benchmarked, including assessing breast cancer risk from histopathological imagery, guiding anti-venom selection from snake images, and diagnosing skin lesions. USA [ edit ] United States Food & Drug Administration [ 141 ] In 2015, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued rules and regulations to protect the privacy of individuals\u2019 health information,  requiring healthcare providers to follow certain privacy rules when using AI, to keep a record of how they use AI and to ensure that their AI systems are secure. [ 142 ] In May 2016, the White House announced its plan to host a series of workshops and formation of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. [ citation needed ] In October 2016, the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, outlining its proposed priorities for Federally-funded AI research and development (within government and academia). The report notes a strategic R&D plan for the subfield of health information technology was in development stages. [ citation needed ] In January 2021, the US FDA published a new Action Plan, entitled Artificial Intelligence (AI) /Machine Learning (ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) Action Plan. [ 143 ] It layed out the FDA's future plans for regulation of medical devices that would include artificial intelligence in their software with five main actions: 1. Tailored Regulatory Framework for Ai/M:-based SaMD, 2. Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP), 3. Patient-Centered Approach Incorporating Transparency to Users, 4. Regulatory Science Methods Related to Algorithm Bias & Robustness, and 5. Real-World Performance(RWP). This plan was in direct response to stakeholders' feedback on a 2019 discussion paper also published by the FDA. [ 143 ] Under President Biden the DHSS and the National Institute of Standards and Technology were instructed to develop regulation of healthcare AI. [ 132 ] According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , the OCR issued guidance on the ethical use of AI in healthcare in 2021. It outlined four core ethical principles that must be followed: respect for autonomy , beneficence (ethics) , non-maleficence , and justice. Respect for autonomy requires that individuals have control over their own data and decisions. Beneficence requires that AI be used to do good, such as improving the quality of care and reducing health disparities. Non-maleficence requires that AI be used to do no harm, such as avoiding discrimination in decisions. Finally, justice requires that AI be used fairly, such as using the same standards for decisions no matter a person's race, gender, or income level. As of March 2021, the OCR had hired a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (OCAIO) to pursue the \"implementation of the HHS AI strategy\". [ 144 ] With the second Trump administration deregulation of health AI began on January 20, 2025 with merely voluntary standards for collecting and sharing data, statutory definitions for algorithmic discrimination, automation bias, and equity being cancelled, cuts to NIST and 19% of FDA workforce eliminated. [ 132 ] Europe [ edit ] Other countries have implemented data protection regulations, more specifically with company privacy invasions. In Denmark, the Danish Expert Group on data ethics has adopted recommendations on 'Data for the Benefit of the People'. These recommendations are intended to encourage the responsible use of data in the business sector, with a focus on data processing. The recommendations include a focus on equality and non-discrimination with regard to bias in AI, as well as human dignity which is to outweigh profit and must be respected in all data processes. [ 145 ] The European Union has implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect citizens' personal data, which applies to the use of AI in healthcare. In addition, the European Commission has established guidelines to ensure the ethical development of AI, including the use of algorithms to ensure fairness and transparency. [ 146 ] With GDPR, the European Union was the first to regulate AI through data protection legislation. The Union finds privacy as a fundamental human right, it wants to prevent unconsented and secondary uses of data by private or public health facilities. By streamlining access to personal data for health research and findings, they are able to instate the right and importance of patient privacy. [ 146 ] In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires organizations to protect the privacy and security of patient information. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have also released guidelines for the development of AI-based medical applications. [ 147 ] In 2025, Europe was leading the USA on AI regulation, while lagging in innovation and at least one California-based biotech company was \"engaging the European Medicines Agency earlier in development than previously anticipated to mitigate concerns about the FDA's ability to meet development timelines.\" [ 132 ] Ethical concerns [ edit ] While research on the use of AI in healthcare aims to validate its efficacy in improving patient outcomes before its broader adoption, its use may introduce several new types of risk to patients and healthcare providers, such as algorithmic bias , Do not resuscitate implications, and other machine morality issues. AI may also compromise the protection of patients' rights, such as the right to informed consent and the right to medical data protection. [ 148 ] Data collection, privacy - autonomy [ edit ] In order to effectively train Machine Learning and use AI in healthcare, massive amounts of data must be gathered. Acquiring this data, however, comes at the cost of patient privacy , i.e. autonomy in most cases and is not well received publicly. For example, a survey conducted in the UK estimated that 63% of the population is uncomfortable with sharing their personal data in order to improve artificial intelligence technology. [ 149 ] The scarcity of real, accessible patient data is a hindrance that deters the progress of developing and deploying more artificial intelligence in healthcare. The lack of regulations surrounding AI in the United States has generated concerns about mismanagement of patient data, such as with corporations utilizing patient data for financial gain. For example, as of 2020 Roche , a Swiss healthcare company, was found to have purchased healthcare data for approximately 2 million cancer patients at an estimated total cost of $1.9 billion. [ 150 ] Naturally, this generates questions of ethical concern; Is there a monetary price that can be set for data, and should it depend on its perceived value or contributions to science? Is it fair to patients to sell their data? These concerns were addressed in a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2022 that asked Americans for their opinions about the increased presence of AI in their daily lives, and the survey estimated that 37% of Americans were more concerned than excited about such increased presence, with 8% of participants specifically associating their concern with \"people misusing AI\". [ 151 ] Ultimately, the current potential of artificial intelligence in healthcare is additionally hindered by  concerns about mismanagement of data collected, especially in the United States. Automation- beneficence [ edit ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic , or fulfill beneficence . [ 16 ] According to a 2019 study, AI can replace up to 35% of jobs in the UK within the next 10 to 20 years. [ 152 ] However, of these jobs, it was concluded that AI has not eliminated any healthcare jobs so far. Though if AI were to automate healthcare-related jobs, the jobs most susceptible to automation would be those dealing with digital information, radiology, and pathology, as opposed to those dealing with doctor-to-patient interaction. [ 152 ] Ouutputs can be incorrect or incomplete and diagnosis and recommendations harm people. [ 132 ] Bias, discrimination [ edit ] Since AI makes decisions solely on the data it receives as input, it is important that this data represents accurate patient demographics. In a hospital setting, patients do not have full knowledge of how predictive algorithms are created or calibrated. Therefore, these medical establishments can unfairly code their algorithms to discriminate against minorities and prioritize profits rather than providing optimal care, i.e. violating the ethical principle of social justice or non-maleficence . [ 153 ] A recent scoping review identified 18 equity challenges along with 15 strategies that can be implemented to help address them when AI applications are developed using many-to-many mapping. [ 154 ] There can be unintended bias in algorithms that can exacerbate social and healthcare inequities. [ 153 ] Since AI's decisions are a direct reflection of its input data, the data it receives must have accurate representation of patient demographics. For instance, if populations are less represented in healthcare data it is likely to create bias in AI tools that lead to incorrect assumptions of a demographic and impact the ability to provide appropriate care. [ 155 ] White males are overly represented in medical data sets. [ 156 ] Therefore, having minimal patient data on minorities can lead to AI making more accurate predictions for majority populations, leading to unintended worse medical outcomes for minority populations. [ 157 ] Collecting data from minority communities can also lead to medical discrimination. For instance, HIV is a prevalent virus among minority communities and HIV status can be used to discriminate against patients. [ 156 ] In addition to biases that may arise from sample selection, different clinical systems used to collect data may also impact AI functionality. For example, radiographic systems and their outcomes (e.g., resolution) vary by provider. Moreover, clinician work practices, such as the positioning of the patient for radiography, can also greatly influence the data and make comparability difficult. [ 158 ] However, these biases are able to be eliminated through careful implementation and a methodical collection of representative data. A final source of algorithmic bias , which has been called \"label choice bias\", arises when proxy measures are used to train algorithms, that build in bias against certain groups. For example, a widely used algorithm predicted health care costs as a proxy for health care needs, and used predictions to allocate resources to help patients with complex health needs. This introduced bias because Black patients have lower costs, even when they are just as unhealthy as White patients. [ 159 ] Solutions to the \"label choice bias\" aim to match the actual target (what the algorithm is predicting) more closely to the ideal target (what researchers want the algorithm to predict), so for the prior example, instead of predicting cost, researchers would focus on the variable of healthcare needs which is rather more significant. Adjusting the target led to almost double the number of Black patients being selected for the program. History [ edit ] Research in the 1960s and 1970s produced the first problem-solving program, or expert system , known as Dendral . [ 160 ] [ 161 ] While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry, it provided the basis for a subsequent system MYCIN , [ 162 ] considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine. [ 162 ] [ 163 ] MYCIN and other systems such as INTERNIST-1 and CASNET did not achieve routine use by practitioners, however. [ 164 ] The 1980s and 1990s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity. During this time, there was a recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physicians. [ 165 ] Approaches involving fuzzy set theory, [ 166 ] Bayesian networks , [ 167 ] and artificial neural networks , [ 168 ] [ 169 ] have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare. Medical and technological advancements occurring over this half-century period that have enabled the growth of healthcare-related applications of AI to include: Improvements in computing power resulting in faster data collection and data processing [ 170 ] Growth of genomic sequencing databases [ 171 ] Widespread implementation of electronic health record systems [ 172 ] Improvements in natural language processing and computer vision , enabling machines to replicate human perceptual processes [ 173 ] [ 174 ] Enhanced the precision of robot-assisted surgery [ 175 ] Increased tree-based machine learning models that allow flexibility in establishing health predictors [ 176 ] Improvements in deep learning techniques and data logs for rare diseases See also [ edit ] AI alignment Artificial intelligence in mental health Artificial intelligence Glossary of artificial intelligence Full body scanner (i.e. Dermascanner , ...)

In some cases, it can exceed or augment human capabilities by providing better or faster ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] As the widespread use of AI in healthcare is still relatively new, research is ongoing into its applications across various medical subdisciplines and related industries. AI programs are being applied to practices such as diagnostics , [ 4 ] treatment protocol development, [ 5 ] drug development , [ 6 ] personalized medicine , [ 7 ] and patient monitoring and care. [ 8 ] Since radiographs are the most commonly performed imaging tests in radiology, the potential for AI to assist with triage and interpretation of radiographs is particularly significant. [ 9 ] Using AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy , automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases . [ 10 ] Furthermore, new technologies such as AI are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption. [ 11 ] In contrast, there are also several cases where AI has been put to use in healthcare without proper testing. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic. [ 16 ] Moreover, meta-studies have found that the scientific literature on AI in healthcare often suffers from a lack of reproducibility . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Applications in healthcare systems [ edit ] Disease diagnosis [ edit ] Accurate and early diagnosis of diseases is still a challenge in healthcare. Recognizing medical conditions and their symptoms is a complex problem. AI can assist clinicians with its data processing capabilities to save time and improve accuracy. [ 21 ] Through the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence can be able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the analysis of mass electronic health records (EHRs). [ 22 ] AI can help early prediction, for example, of Alzheimer's disease and dementias , by looking through large numbers of similar cases and possible treatments. [ 23 ] AI can aid doctors' decision-making in emergency cases, for example, in emergency departments. AI algorithms may assist in prioritizing critical cases, cutting down waiting times. Also, AI-backed decision support systems make recommendations instantly and enable quicker interpretation of data, which supports healthcare professionals' decisions. [ 21 ] In 2023 a study reported higher satisfaction rates with ChatGPT -generated responses compared with those from physicians for medical questions posted on Reddit \u2019s r/AskDocs. [ 24 ] Evaluators preferred ChatGPT's responses to physician responses in 78.6% of 585 evaluations, noting better quality and empathy. The authors noted that these were isolated questions taken from an online forum, not in the context of an established patient-physician relationship. [ 24 ] Moreover, responses were not graded on the accuracy of medical information, and some have argued that the experiment was not properly blinded , with the evaluators being coauthors of the study. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Recent developments in statistical physics , machine learning , and inference algorithms are also being explored for their potential in improving medical diagnostic approaches. [ 28 ] Also, the establishment of large healthcare-related data warehouses of sometimes hundreds of millions of patients provides extensive training data for AI models. [ 29 ] Electronic health records [ edit ] Electronic health records (EHR) are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. Now that around 80% of medical practices use EHR, some anticipate the use of artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians. [ 30 ] One application uses natural language processing (NLP) to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms. [ 30 ] For example, the term heart attack and myocardial infarction mean the same things, but physicians may use one over the other based on personal preferences. [ 30 ] NLP algorithms consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed. [ 30 ] Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician's notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read. [ 30 ] Other applications use concept processing to analyze the information entered by the current patient's doctor to present similar cases and help the physician remember to include all relevant details. [ 31 ] Beyond making content edits to an EHR, there are AI algorithms that evaluate an individual patient's record and predict a risk for a disease based on their previous information and family history. [ 32 ] One general algorithm is a rule-based system that makes decisions similarly to how humans use flow charts. [ 33 ] This system takes in large amounts of data and creates a set of rules that connect specific observations to concluded diagnoses. [ 33 ] Thus, the algorithm can take in a new patient's data and try to predict the likeliness that they will have a certain condition or disease. [ 33 ] Since the algorithms can evaluate a patient's information based on collective data, they can find any outstanding issues to bring to a physician's attention and save time. [ 32 ] One study conducted by the Centerstone research institute found that predictive modeling of EHR data has achieved 70\u201372% accuracy in predicting individualized treatment response. [ 34 ] These methods are helpful due to the fact that the amount of online health records doubles every five years. [ 32 ] Physicians do not have the bandwidth to process all this data manually, and AI can leverage this data to assist physicians in treating their patients. [ 32 ] Drug interactions [ edit ] Improvements in natural language processing led to the development of algorithms to identify drug-drug interactions in medical literature. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Drug-drug interactions pose a threat to those taking multiple medications simultaneously, and the danger increases with the number of medications being taken. [ 39 ] To address the difficulty of tracking all known or suspected drug-drug interactions, machine learning algorithms have been created to extract information on interacting drugs and their possible effects from medical literature. Efforts were consolidated in 2013 in the DDIExtraction Challenge, in which a team of researchers at Carlos III University assembled a corpus of literature on drug-drug interactions to form a standardized test for such algorithms. [ 40 ] Competitors were tested on their ability to accurately determine, from the text, which drugs were shown to interact and what the characteristics of their interactions were. [ 41 ] Researchers continue to use this corpus to standardize the measurement of the effectiveness of their algorithms. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 38 ] Other algorithms identify drug-drug interactions from patterns in user-generated content , especially electronic health records and/or adverse event reports. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Organizations such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the World Health Organization's VigiBase allow doctors to submit reports of possible negative reactions to medications. Deep learning algorithms have been developed to parse these reports and detect patterns that imply drug-drug interactions. [ 42 ] Telemedicine [ edit ] An elderly man using a pulse oximeter to measure his blood oxygen levels The increase of telemedicine , the treatment of patients remotely, has shown the rise of possible AI applications. [ 43 ] AI can assist in caring for patients remotely by monitoring their information through sensors. [ 44 ] A wearable device may allow for constant monitoring of a patient and the ability to notice changes that may be less distinguishable by humans. The information can be compared to other data that has already been collected using artificial intelligence algorithms that alert physicians if there are any issues to be aware of. [ 44 ] Another application of artificial intelligence is chat-bot therapy. Some researchers charge that the reliance on chatbots for mental healthcare does not offer the reciprocity and accountability of care that should exist in the relationship between the consumer of mental healthcare and the care provider (be it a chat-bot or psychologist), though. [ 45 ] Some examples of these chatbots include Woebot, Earkick and Wysa. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Since the average age has risen due to a longer life expectancy, artificial intelligence could be useful in helping take care of older populations. [ 49 ] Tools such as environment and personal sensors can identify a person's regular activities and alert a caretaker if a behavior or a measured vital is abnormal. [ 49 ] Although the technology is useful, there are also discussions about limitations of monitoring in order to respect a person's privacy since there are technologies that are designed to map out home layouts and detect human interactions. [ 49 ] Workload management [ edit ] AI has the potential to streamline care coordination and reduce the workload. AI algorithms can automate administrative tasks, prioritize patient needs and facilitate seamless communication in a healthcare team. [ 50 ] This enables healthcare providers to focus more on direct patient care and ensures the efficient and coordinated delivery of healthcare services. Clinical applications [ edit ] Cardiovascular [ edit ] Artificial intelligence algorithms have shown promising results in accurately diagnosing and risk stratifying patients with concern for coronary artery disease, showing potential as an initial triage tool. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Other algorithms have been used in predicting patient mortality, medication effects, and adverse events following treatment for acute coronary syndrome . [ 51 ] Wearables, smartphones, and internet-based technologies have also shown the ability to monitor patients' cardiac data points, expanding the amount of data and the various settings AI models can use and potentially enabling earlier detection of cardiac events occurring outside of the hospital. [ 53 ] A research in 2019 found that AI can be used to predict heart attack with up to 90% accuracy. [ 54 ] Another growing area of research is the utility of AI in classifying heart sounds and diagnosing valvular disease . [ 55 ] Challenges of AI in cardiovascular medicine have included the limited data available to train machine learning models, such as limited data on social determinants of health as they pertain to cardiovascular disease . [ 56 ] A key limitation in early studies evaluating AI were omissions of data comparing algorithmic performance to humans. Examples of studies which assess AI performance relative to physicians includes how AI is non-inferior to humans in interpretation of cardiac echocardiograms [ 57 ] and that AI can diagnose heart attack better than human physicians in the emergency setting, reducing both low-value testing and missed diagnoses. [ 58 ] In cardiovascular tissue engineering and organoid studies, AI is increasingly used to analyze microscopy images, and integrate electrophysiological read outs. [ 59 ] Dermatology [ edit ] Medical imaging (such as X-ray and photography) is a commonly used tool in dermatology [ 60 ] and the development of deep learning has been strongly tied to image\u00a0processing . Therefore, there is a natural fit between the dermatology and deep learning. Machine learning learning holds great potential to process these images for better diagnoses. [ 61 ] Han et al. showed keratinocytic skin cancer detection from face photographs. [ 62 ] Esteva et al. demonstrated dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer from lesion images. [ 63 ] Noyan et al. demonstrated a convolutional neural network that achieved 94% accuracy at identifying skin cells from microscopic Tzanck smear images. [ 64 ] A concern raised with this work is that it has not engaged with disparities related to skin color or differential treatment of patients with non-white skin tones. [ 65 ] According to some researchers, AI algorithms have been shown to be more effective than dermatologists at identifying cancer. [ 66 ] However, a 2021 review article found that a majority of papers analyzing the performance of AI algorithms designed for skin cancer classification failed to use external test sets. [ 67 ] Only four research studies were found in which the AI algorithms were tested on clinics, regions, or populations distinct from those it was trained on, and in each of those four studies, the performance of dermatologists was found to be on par with that of the algorithm. Moreover, only one study [ 68 ] was set in the context of a full clinical examination; others were based on interaction through web-apps or online questionnaires, with most based entirely on context-free images of lesions. In this study, it was found that dermatologists significantly outperformed the algorithms. Many articles claiming superior performance of AI algorithms also fail to distinguish between trainees and board-certified dermatologists in their analyses. [ 67 ] It has also been suggested that AI could be used to automatically evaluate the outcome of maxillo-facial surgery or cleft palate therapy in regard to facial attractiveness or age appearance. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Gastroenterology [ edit ] AI can play a role in various facets of the field of gastroenterology . Endoscopic exams such as esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD) and colonoscopies rely on rapid detection of abnormal tissue. By enhancing these endoscopic procedures with AI, clinicians can more rapidly identify diseases, determine their severity, and visualize blind spots. Early trials in using AI detection systems of early stomach cancer have shown sensitivity close to expert endoscopists. [ 71 ] AI can assist doctors treating ulcerative colitis in detecting the microscopic activity of the disease in people and predicting when flare-ups will happen. For example, an AI-powered tool  was developed to analyse digitised bowel samples ( biopsies ). The tool was able to distinguish with 80% accuracy between samples that show remission of colitis and those with active disease. It also predicted the risk of a flare-up happening with the same accuracy. These rates of successfully using microscopic disease activity to predict disease flare are similar to the accuracy of pathologists . [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Obstetrics and gynaecology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence utilises massive amounts of data to help with predicting illness, prevention, and diagnosis, as well as patient monitoring. In obstetrics, artificial intelligence is utilized in magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and foetal cardiotocography. AI contributes in the resolution of a variety of obstetrical diagnostic issues. [ 74 ] Infectious diseases [ edit ] AI has shown potential in both the laboratory and clinical spheres of infectious disease medicine. [ 75 ] During the COVID-19 pandemic , AI has been used for early detection, tracking virus spread and analysing virus behaviour, among other things. [ 76 ] However, there were only a few examples of AI being used directly in clinical practice during the pandemic itself. [ 77 ] Other applications  of AI around infectious diseases include support-vector machines identifying antimicrobial resistance , machine learning analysis of blood smears to detect malaria , and improved point-of-care testing of Lyme disease based on antigen detection. Additionally, AI has been investigated for improving diagnosis of meningitis , sepsis , and tuberculosis , as well as predicting treatment complications in hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients. [ 75 ] Musculoskeletal [ edit ] AI has been used to identify causes of knee pain that doctors miss, that disproportionately affect Black patients. [ 78 ] Underserved populations experience higher levels of pain. These disparities persist even after controlling for the objective severity of diseases like osteoarthritis, as graded by human physicians using medical images, raising the possibility that underserved patients\u2019 pain stems from factors external to the knee, such as stress. Researchers have conducted a study using a machine-learning algorithm to show that standard radiographic measures of severity overlook objective but undiagnosed features that disproportionately affect diagnosis and management of underserved populations with knee pain. They proposed that new algorithmic measure ALG-P could potentially enable expanded access to treatments for underserved patients. [ 79 ] Neurology [ edit ] The use of AI technologies has been explored for use in the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For diagnostic purposes, machine learning models have been developed that rely on structural MRI inputs. [ 80 ] The input datasets for these models are drawn from databases such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. [ 81 ] Researchers have developed models that rely on convolutional neural networks with the aim of improving early diagnostic accuracy. [ 82 ] Generative adversarial networks are a form of deep learning that have also performed well in diagnosing AD. [ 83 ] There have also been efforts to develop machine learning models into forecasting tools that can predict the prognosis of patients with AD. Forecasting patient outcomes through generative models has been proposed by researchers as a means of synthesizing training and validation sets. [ 84 ] They suggest that generated patient forecasts could be used to provide future models larger training datasets than current open access databases. Oncology [ edit ] AI has been explored for use in cancer diagnosis, risk stratification, molecular characterization of tumors, and cancer drug discovery. A particular challenge in oncologic care that AI is being developed to address is the ability to accurately predict which treatment protocols will be best suited for each patient based on their individual genetic, molecular, and tumor-based characteristics. [ 85 ] AI has been trialed in cancer diagnostics with the reading of imaging studies and pathology slides. [ 86 ] In January 2020, Google DeepMind announced an algorithm capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer detection in screening scans. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] A number of researchers, including Trevor Hastie , Joelle Pineau , and Robert Tibshirani among others, published a reply claiming that DeepMind's research publication in Nature lacked key details on methodology and code, \"effectively undermin[ing] its scientific value\" and making it impossible for the scientific community to confirm the work. [ 89 ] In the MIT Technology Review , author Benjamin Haibe-Kains characterized DeepMind's work as \"an advertisement\" having little to do with science. [ 90 ] In July 2020, it was reported that an AI algorithm developed by the University of Pittsburgh achieves the highest accuracy to date in identifying prostate cancer , with 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] In 2023 a study reported the use of AI for CT -based radiomics classification at grading the aggressiveness of retroperitoneal sarcoma with 82% accuracy compared with 44% for lab analysis of biopsies. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Ophthalmology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence-enhanced technology is being used as an aid in the screening of eye disease and prevention of blindness. [ 95 ] In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the marketing of the first medical device to diagnose a specific type of eye disease, diabetic retinopathy using an artificial intelligence algorithm. [ 96 ] Moreover, AI technology may be used to further improve \"diagnosis rates\" because of the potential to decrease detection time. [ 97 ] Pathology [ edit ] Further information: Digital pathology Ki67 stain calculation by the open-source software QuPath in a pure seminoma, which gives a measure of the proliferation rate of the tumor. The colors represent the intensity of expression: blue-no expression, yellow-low, orange-moderate, and red-high expression. [ 98 ] For many diseases, pathological analysis of cells and tissues is considered to be the gold standard of disease diagnosis. Methods of digital pathology allows microscopy slides to be scanned and digitally analyzed. AI-assisted pathology tools have been developed to assist with the diagnosis of a number of diseases, including breast cancer, hepatitis B, gastric cancer , and colorectal cancer . AI has also been used to predict genetic mutations and prognosticate disease outcomes. [ 71 ] AI is well-suited for use in low-complexity pathological analysis of large-scale screening samples, such as colorectal or breast cancer screening, thus lessening the burden on pathologists and allowing for faster turnaround of sample analysis. [ 99 ] Several deep learning and artificial neural network models have shown accuracy similar to that of human pathologists, [ 99 ] and a study of deep learning assistance in diagnosing metastatic breast cancer in lymph nodes showed that the accuracy of humans with the assistance of a deep learning program was higher than either the humans alone or the AI program alone. [ 100 ] Additionally, implementation of digital pathology is predicted to save over $12 million for a university center over the course of five years, [ 101 ] though savings attributed to AI specifically have not yet been widely researched. The use of augmented and virtual reality could prove to be a stepping stone to wider implementation of AI-assisted pathology, as they can highlight areas of concern on a pathology sample and present them in real-time to a pathologist for more efficient review. [ 99 ] AI also has the potential to identify histological findings at levels beyond what the human eye can see, [ 99 ] and has shown the ability to use genotypic and phenotypic data to more accurately detect the tumor of origin for metastatic cancer. [ 102 ] One of the major current barriers to widespread implementation of AI-assisted pathology tools is the lack of prospective, randomized, multi-center controlled trials in determining the true clinical utility of AI for pathologists and patients, highlighting a current area of need in AI and healthcare research. [ 99 ] Primary care [ edit ] Primary care has become one key development area for AI technologies. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] AI in primary care has been used for supporting decision making, predictive modeling, and business analytics. [ 105 ] There are only a few examples of AI decision support systems that were prospectively assessed on clinical efficacy when used in practice by physicians. But there are cases where the use of these systems yielded a positive effect on treatment choice by physicians. [ 106 ] As of 2022 in relation to elder care, AI robots had been helpful in guiding older residents living in assisted living with entertainment and company. These bots are allowing staff in the home to have more one-on-one time with each resident, but the bots are also programmed with more ability in what they are able to do; such as knowing different languages and different types of care depending on the patient's conditions. The bot is an AI machine, which means it goes through the same training as any other machine - using algorithms to parse the given data, learn from it and predict the outcome in relation to what situation is at hand. [ 107 ] Psychiatry [ edit ] In psychiatry, AI applications are still in a phase of proof-of-concept. [ 108 ] Areas where the evidence is widening quickly include predictive modelling of diagnosis and treatment outcomes, [ 109 ] chatbots, conversational agents that imitate human behaviour and which have been studied for anxiety and depression. [ 110 ] Challenges include the fact that many applications in the field are developed and proposed by private corporations, such as the screening for suicidal ideation implemented by Facebook in 2017. [ 111 ] Such applications outside the healthcare system raise various professional, ethical and regulatory questions. [ 112 ] Another issue is often with the validity and interpretability of the models. Small training datasets contain bias that is inherited by the models, and compromises the generalizability and stability of these models. Such models may also have the potential to be discriminatory against minority groups that are underrepresented in samples. [ 113 ] In 2023, US-based National Eating Disorders Association replaced its human helpline staff with a chatbot but had to take it offline after users reported receiving harmful advice from it. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] Radiology [ edit ] AI is being studied within the field of radiology to detect and diagnose diseases through computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. [ 117 ] It may be particularly useful in settings where demand for human expertise exceeds supply, or where data is too complex to be efficiently interpreted by human readers. [ 118 ] Several deep learning models have shown the capability to be roughly as accurate as healthcare professionals in identifying diseases through medical imaging, though few of the studies reporting these findings have been externally validated. [ 119 ] AI can also provide non-interpretive benefit to radiologists, such as reducing noise in images, creating high-quality images from lower doses of radiation, enhancing MR image quality, [ 120 ] and automatically assessing image quality. [ 121 ] Further research investigating the use of AI in nuclear medicine focuses on image reconstruction, anatomical landmarking, and the enablement of lower doses in imaging studies. [ 122 ] The analysis of images for supervised AI applications in radiology encompasses two primary techniques at present: (1) convolutional neural network-based analysis; and (2) utilization of radiomics . [ 118 ] AI is also used in breast imaging for analyzing screening mammograms and can participate in improving breast cancer detection rate [ 123 ] as well as reducing radiologist's reading workload.

Artificial intelligence is playing a crucial role in driving the application and research in many fields and pharmacy is no exception. In pharmacy, the use of AI is leading to the discovery, development, and delivery of medications , and also enhancing patient care through personalized treatment plans. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] This article is going to summarize AI's application in drug research, drug safety, dose recommendation and examine the limitations and future directions of AI in pharmacy. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Industry [ edit ] The trend of large health companies merging allows for greater health data accessibility. Greater health data lays the groundwork for the implementation of AI algorithms. A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the clinical decision support systems . As more data is collected, machine learning algorithms adapt and allow for more robust responses and solutions. [ 117 ] Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of big data in the healthcare industry. Many companies investigate the market opportunities through the realms of \"data assessment, storage, management, and analysis technologies\" which are all crucial parts of the healthcare industry. [ 131 ] With the market for AI expanding constantly, large tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Baidu all have their own AI research divisions, as well as millions of dollars allocated for acquisition of smaller AI based companies. [ 131 ] The following are examples of large companies that are contributing to AI algorithms for use in healthcare: Amazon Web Services [ 132 ] Apple [ 132 ] Google 's DeepMind platform is being used by the UK National Health Service to detect certain health risks through data collected via a mobile app. A second project with the NHS involves the analysis of medical images collected from NHS patients to develop computer vision algorithms to detect cancerous tissues. IBM's Watson Oncology is in development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Cleveland Clinic . IBM is also working with CVS Health on AI applications in chronic disease treatment and with Johnson & Johnson on analysis of scientific papers to find new connections for drug development. In May 2017, IBM and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute began a joint project entitled Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning and Semantics (HEALS) , to explore using AI technology to enhance healthcare. Intel's venture capital arm Intel Capital invested in 2016 in the startup Lumiata, which uses AI to identify at-risk patients and develop care options. [ 133 ] Meta [ 132 ] Microsoft 's Hanover project, in partnership with Oregon Health & Science University 's Knight Cancer Institute, analyzes medical research to predict the most effective cancer drug treatment options for patients. Other projects include medical image analysis of tumor progression and the development of programmable cells. [ 134 ] Neuralink has come up with a next-generation neuroprosthetic which intricately interfaces with thousands of neural pathways in the brain. [ 117 ] Their process allows a chip, roughly the size of a quarter, to be inserted in the place of a chunk of a skull by a precision surgical robot to avoid accidental injury . [ 117 ] Elon Musk premiering the surgical robot that implants the Neuralink brain chip Ava Industries Ltd., a Canadian healthcare technology firm, is developing integrated AI tools to support clinical efficiency. Ava has implemented an embedded AI medical scribe within theis electronic medical record system (EMR) and is further developing tools such as an AI chart summarizer and an AI document classifier. [1] The company has received support through grants from Canada Health Infowayfor its work in advancing digital health solutions. [2] Tencent is working on several medical systems and services. These include AI Medical Innovation System (AIMIS) , an AI-powered diagnostic medical imaging service; WeChat Intelligent Healthcare; and Tencent Doctorwork Digital consultant apps use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user's medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution[ buzzword ] to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user (e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus) and value capturing mechanisms (e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders). IFlytek launched a service robot \"Xiao Man\", which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas. [ citation needed ] It also works in the field of medical imaging. Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH (\"Cruzr\") and Softbank Robotics (\"Pepper\"). [ citation needed ] The Indian startup Haptik developed a WhatsApp chatbot in 2021 which answers questions associated with the deadly coronavirus in India . Similarly, a software platform ChatBot in partnership with medtech startup Infermedica launched COVID-19 Risk Assessment ChatBot. [ 135 ] Many automobile manufacturers are beginning to use machine learning healthcare in their cars as well. [ 131 ] Companies such as BMW , GE , Tesla , Toyota , and Volvo all have new research campaigns to find ways of learning a driver's vital statistics to ensure they are awake, paying attention to the road, and not under the influence of substances. [ 131 ] Expanding care to developing nations [ edit ] Artificial intelligence continues to expand in its abilities to diagnose more people accurately in nations where fewer doctors are accessible to the public.\u00a0 Many new technology companies such as SpaceX and the Raspberry Pi Foundation have enabled more developing countries to have access to computers and the internet than ever before. [ 136 ] With the increasing capabilities of AI over the internet, advanced machine learning algorithms can allow patients to get accurately diagnosed when they would previously have no way of knowing if they had a life-threatening disease or not. [ 136 ] Using AI in developing nations that do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can improve patient care. AI can allow for not only diagnosis of patient in areas where healthcare is scarce, but also allow for a good patient experience by resourcing files to find the best treatment for a patient. [ 137 ] The ability of AI to adjust course as it goes also allows the patient to have their treatment modified based on what works for them; a level of individualized care that is nearly non-existent in developing countries. [ 137 ] Regulation [ edit ] This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( May 2025 ) Challenges of the clinical use of AI have brought about a potential need for regulations . AI studies need to be completely and transparently reported to have value to inform regulatory approval. Depending on the phase of study, international consensus-based reporting guidelines (TRIPOD+AI, [ 138 ] DECIDE-AI, [ 139 ] CONSORT-AI [ 140 ] ) have been developed to provide recommendations on the key details that need to be reported. A man speaking at the GDPR compliance workshop at the 2019 Entrepreneurship Summit While regulations exist pertaining to the collection of patient data such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the US ( HIPAA ) and the European General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) pertaining to patients within the EU, health care AI is \u201c\"severely under-regulated worldwide\" as of 2025. [ 132 ] Unclear is whether healthcare AI can be classified merely as software or as medical device . [ 132 ] United Nations (WHO/ITU) [ edit ] The joint ITU - WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H) has built a platform - known as the ITU-WHO AI for Health Framework - for the testing and benchmarking of AI applications in health domain. As of November 2018, eight use cases are being benchmarked, including assessing breast cancer risk from histopathological imagery, guiding anti-venom selection from snake images, and diagnosing skin lesions. USA [ edit ] United States Food & Drug Administration [ 141 ] In 2015, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued rules and regulations to protect the privacy of individuals\u2019 health information,  requiring healthcare providers to follow certain privacy rules when using AI, to keep a record of how they use AI and to ensure that their AI systems are secure. [ 142 ] In May 2016, the White House announced its plan to host a series of workshops and formation of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. [ citation needed ] In October 2016, the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, outlining its proposed priorities for Federally-funded AI research and development (within government and academia). The report notes a strategic R&D plan for the subfield of health information technology was in development stages. [ citation needed ] In January 2021, the US FDA published a new Action Plan, entitled Artificial Intelligence (AI) /Machine Learning (ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) Action Plan. [ 143 ] It layed out the FDA's future plans for regulation of medical devices that would include artificial intelligence in their software with five main actions: 1. Tailored Regulatory Framework for Ai/M:-based SaMD, 2. Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP), 3. Patient-Centered Approach Incorporating Transparency to Users, 4. Regulatory Science Methods Related to Algorithm Bias & Robustness, and 5. Real-World Performance(RWP). This plan was in direct response to stakeholders' feedback on a 2019 discussion paper also published by the FDA. [ 143 ] Under President Biden the DHSS and the National Institute of Standards and Technology were instructed to develop regulation of healthcare AI. [ 132 ] According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , the OCR issued guidance on the ethical use of AI in healthcare in 2021. It outlined four core ethical principles that must be followed: respect for autonomy , beneficence (ethics) , non-maleficence , and justice. Respect for autonomy requires that individuals have control over their own data and decisions. Beneficence requires that AI be used to do good, such as improving the quality of care and reducing health disparities. Non-maleficence requires that AI be used to do no harm, such as avoiding discrimination in decisions. Finally, justice requires that AI be used fairly, such as using the same standards for decisions no matter a person's race, gender, or income level. As of March 2021, the OCR had hired a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (OCAIO) to pursue the \"implementation of the HHS AI strategy\". [ 144 ] With the second Trump administration deregulation of health AI began on January 20, 2025 with merely voluntary standards for collecting and sharing data, statutory definitions for algorithmic discrimination, automation bias, and equity being cancelled, cuts to NIST and 19% of FDA workforce eliminated. [ 132 ] Europe [ edit ] Other countries have implemented data protection regulations, more specifically with company privacy invasions. In Denmark, the Danish Expert Group on data ethics has adopted recommendations on 'Data for the Benefit of the People'. These recommendations are intended to encourage the responsible use of data in the business sector, with a focus on data processing. The recommendations include a focus on equality and non-discrimination with regard to bias in AI, as well as human dignity which is to outweigh profit and must be respected in all data processes. [ 145 ] The European Union has implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect citizens' personal data, which applies to the use of AI in healthcare. In addition, the European Commission has established guidelines to ensure the ethical development of AI, including the use of algorithms to ensure fairness and transparency. [ 146 ] With GDPR, the European Union was the first to regulate AI through data protection legislation. The Union finds privacy as a fundamental human right, it wants to prevent unconsented and secondary uses of data by private or public health facilities. By streamlining access to personal data for health research and findings, they are able to instate the right and importance of patient privacy. [ 146 ] In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires organizations to protect the privacy and security of patient information. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have also released guidelines for the development of AI-based medical applications. [ 147 ] In 2025, Europe was leading the USA on AI regulation, while lagging in innovation and at least one California-based biotech company was \"engaging the European Medicines Agency earlier in development than previously anticipated to mitigate concerns about the FDA's ability to meet development timelines.\" [ 132 ] Ethical concerns [ edit ] While research on the use of AI in healthcare aims to validate its efficacy in improving patient outcomes before its broader adoption, its use may introduce several new types of risk to patients and healthcare providers, such as algorithmic bias , Do not resuscitate implications, and other machine morality issues. AI may also compromise the protection of patients' rights, such as the right to informed consent and the right to medical data protection. [ 148 ] Data collection, privacy - autonomy [ edit ] In order to effectively train Machine Learning and use AI in healthcare, massive amounts of data must be gathered. Acquiring this data, however, comes at the cost of patient privacy , i.e. autonomy in most cases and is not well received publicly. For example, a survey conducted in the UK estimated that 63% of the population is uncomfortable with sharing their personal data in order to improve artificial intelligence technology. [ 149 ] The scarcity of real, accessible patient data is a hindrance that deters the progress of developing and deploying more artificial intelligence in healthcare. The lack of regulations surrounding AI in the United States has generated concerns about mismanagement of patient data, such as with corporations utilizing patient data for financial gain. For example, as of 2020 Roche , a Swiss healthcare company, was found to have purchased healthcare data for approximately 2 million cancer patients at an estimated total cost of $1.9 billion. [ 150 ] Naturally, this generates questions of ethical concern; Is there a monetary price that can be set for data, and should it depend on its perceived value or contributions to science? Is it fair to patients to sell their data? These concerns were addressed in a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2022 that asked Americans for their opinions about the increased presence of AI in their daily lives, and the survey estimated that 37% of Americans were more concerned than excited about such increased presence, with 8% of participants specifically associating their concern with \"people misusing AI\". [ 151 ] Ultimately, the current potential of artificial intelligence in healthcare is additionally hindered by  concerns about mismanagement of data collected, especially in the United States. Automation- beneficence [ edit ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic , or fulfill beneficence . [ 16 ] According to a 2019 study, AI can replace up to 35% of jobs in the UK within the next 10 to 20 years. [ 152 ] However, of these jobs, it was concluded that AI has not eliminated any healthcare jobs so far. Though if AI were to automate healthcare-related jobs, the jobs most susceptible to automation would be those dealing with digital information, radiology, and pathology, as opposed to those dealing with doctor-to-patient interaction. [ 152 ] Ouutputs can be incorrect or incomplete and diagnosis and recommendations harm people. [ 132 ] Bias, discrimination [ edit ] Since AI makes decisions solely on the data it receives as input, it is important that this data represents accurate patient demographics. In a hospital setting, patients do not have full knowledge of how predictive algorithms are created or calibrated. Therefore, these medical establishments can unfairly code their algorithms to discriminate against minorities and prioritize profits rather than providing optimal care, i.e. violating the ethical principle of social justice or non-maleficence . [ 153 ] A recent scoping review identified 18 equity challenges along with 15 strategies that can be implemented to help address them when AI applications are developed using many-to-many mapping. [ 154 ] There can be unintended bias in algorithms that can exacerbate social and healthcare inequities. [ 153 ] Since AI's decisions are a direct reflection of its input data, the data it receives must have accurate representation of patient demographics. For instance, if populations are less represented in healthcare data it is likely to create bias in AI tools that lead to incorrect assumptions of a demographic and impact the ability to provide appropriate care. [ 155 ] White males are overly represented in medical data sets. [ 156 ] Therefore, having minimal patient data on minorities can lead to AI making more accurate predictions for majority populations, leading to unintended worse medical outcomes for minority populations. [ 157 ] Collecting data from minority communities can also lead to medical discrimination. For instance, HIV is a prevalent virus among minority communities and HIV status can be used to discriminate against patients. [ 156 ] In addition to biases that may arise from sample selection, different clinical systems used to collect data may also impact AI functionality. For example, radiographic systems and their outcomes (e.g., resolution) vary by provider. Moreover, clinician work practices, such as the positioning of the patient for radiography, can also greatly influence the data and make comparability difficult. [ 158 ] However, these biases are able to be eliminated through careful implementation and a methodical collection of representative data. A final source of algorithmic bias , which has been called \"label choice bias\", arises when proxy measures are used to train algorithms, that build in bias against certain groups. For example, a widely used algorithm predicted health care costs as a proxy for health care needs, and used predictions to allocate resources to help patients with complex health needs. This introduced bias because Black patients have lower costs, even when they are just as unhealthy as White patients. [ 159 ] Solutions to the \"label choice bias\" aim to match the actual target (what the algorithm is predicting) more closely to the ideal target (what researchers want the algorithm to predict), so for the prior example, instead of predicting cost, researchers would focus on the variable of healthcare needs which is rather more significant. Adjusting the target led to almost double the number of Black patients being selected for the program. History [ edit ] Research in the 1960s and 1970s produced the first problem-solving program, or expert system , known as Dendral . [ 160 ] [ 161 ] While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry, it provided the basis for a subsequent system MYCIN , [ 162 ] considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine. [ 162 ] [ 163 ] MYCIN and other systems such as INTERNIST-1 and CASNET did not achieve routine use by practitioners, however. [ 164 ] The 1980s and 1990s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity. During this time, there was a recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physicians. [ 165 ] Approaches involving fuzzy set theory, [ 166 ] Bayesian networks , [ 167 ] and artificial neural networks , [ 168 ] [ 169 ] have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare. Medical and technological advancements occurring over this half-century period that have enabled the growth of healthcare-related applications of AI to include: Improvements in computing power resulting in faster data collection and data processing [ 170 ] Growth of genomic sequencing databases [ 171 ] Widespread implementation of electronic health record systems [ 172 ] Improvements in natural language processing and computer vision , enabling machines to replicate human perceptual processes [ 173 ] [ 174 ] Enhanced the precision of robot-assisted surgery [ 175 ] Increased tree-based machine learning models that allow flexibility in establishing health predictors [ 176 ] Improvements in deep learning techniques and data logs for rare diseases See also [ edit ] AI alignment Artificial intelligence in mental health Artificial intelligence Glossary of artificial intelligence Full body scanner (i.e. Dermascanner , ...)

In some cases, it can exceed or augment human capabilities by providing better or faster ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] As the widespread use of AI in healthcare is still relatively new, research is ongoing into its applications across various medical subdisciplines and related industries. AI programs are being applied to practices such as diagnostics , [ 4 ] treatment protocol development, [ 5 ] drug development , [ 6 ] personalized medicine , [ 7 ] and patient monitoring and care. [ 8 ] Since radiographs are the most commonly performed imaging tests in radiology, the potential for AI to assist with triage and interpretation of radiographs is particularly significant. [ 9 ] Using AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy , automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases . [ 10 ] Furthermore, new technologies such as AI are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption. [ 11 ] In contrast, there are also several cases where AI has been put to use in healthcare without proper testing. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic. [ 16 ] Moreover, meta-studies have found that the scientific literature on AI in healthcare often suffers from a lack of reproducibility . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Applications in healthcare systems [ edit ] Disease diagnosis [ edit ] Accurate and early diagnosis of diseases is still a challenge in healthcare. Recognizing medical conditions and their symptoms is a complex problem. AI can assist clinicians with its data processing capabilities to save time and improve accuracy. [ 21 ] Through the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence can be able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the analysis of mass electronic health records (EHRs). [ 22 ] AI can help early prediction, for example, of Alzheimer's disease and dementias , by looking through large numbers of similar cases and possible treatments. [ 23 ] AI can aid doctors' decision-making in emergency cases, for example, in emergency departments. AI algorithms may assist in prioritizing critical cases, cutting down waiting times. Also, AI-backed decision support systems make recommendations instantly and enable quicker interpretation of data, which supports healthcare professionals' decisions. [ 21 ] In 2023 a study reported higher satisfaction rates with ChatGPT -generated responses compared with those from physicians for medical questions posted on Reddit \u2019s r/AskDocs. [ 24 ] Evaluators preferred ChatGPT's responses to physician responses in 78.6% of 585 evaluations, noting better quality and empathy. The authors noted that these were isolated questions taken from an online forum, not in the context of an established patient-physician relationship. [ 24 ] Moreover, responses were not graded on the accuracy of medical information, and some have argued that the experiment was not properly blinded , with the evaluators being coauthors of the study. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Recent developments in statistical physics , machine learning , and inference algorithms are also being explored for their potential in improving medical diagnostic approaches. [ 28 ] Also, the establishment of large healthcare-related data warehouses of sometimes hundreds of millions of patients provides extensive training data for AI models. [ 29 ] Electronic health records [ edit ] Electronic health records (EHR) are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. Now that around 80% of medical practices use EHR, some anticipate the use of artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians. [ 30 ] One application uses natural language processing (NLP) to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms. [ 30 ] For example, the term heart attack and myocardial infarction mean the same things, but physicians may use one over the other based on personal preferences. [ 30 ] NLP algorithms consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed. [ 30 ] Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician's notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read. [ 30 ] Other applications use concept processing to analyze the information entered by the current patient's doctor to present similar cases and help the physician remember to include all relevant details. [ 31 ] Beyond making content edits to an EHR, there are AI algorithms that evaluate an individual patient's record and predict a risk for a disease based on their previous information and family history. [ 32 ] One general algorithm is a rule-based system that makes decisions similarly to how humans use flow charts. [ 33 ] This system takes in large amounts of data and creates a set of rules that connect specific observations to concluded diagnoses. [ 33 ] Thus, the algorithm can take in a new patient's data and try to predict the likeliness that they will have a certain condition or disease. [ 33 ] Since the algorithms can evaluate a patient's information based on collective data, they can find any outstanding issues to bring to a physician's attention and save time. [ 32 ] One study conducted by the Centerstone research institute found that predictive modeling of EHR data has achieved 70\u201372% accuracy in predicting individualized treatment response. [ 34 ] These methods are helpful due to the fact that the amount of online health records doubles every five years. [ 32 ] Physicians do not have the bandwidth to process all this data manually, and AI can leverage this data to assist physicians in treating their patients. [ 32 ] Drug interactions [ edit ] Improvements in natural language processing led to the development of algorithms to identify drug-drug interactions in medical literature. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Drug-drug interactions pose a threat to those taking multiple medications simultaneously, and the danger increases with the number of medications being taken. [ 39 ] To address the difficulty of tracking all known or suspected drug-drug interactions, machine learning algorithms have been created to extract information on interacting drugs and their possible effects from medical literature. Efforts were consolidated in 2013 in the DDIExtraction Challenge, in which a team of researchers at Carlos III University assembled a corpus of literature on drug-drug interactions to form a standardized test for such algorithms. [ 40 ] Competitors were tested on their ability to accurately determine, from the text, which drugs were shown to interact and what the characteristics of their interactions were. [ 41 ] Researchers continue to use this corpus to standardize the measurement of the effectiveness of their algorithms. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 38 ] Other algorithms identify drug-drug interactions from patterns in user-generated content , especially electronic health records and/or adverse event reports. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Organizations such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the World Health Organization's VigiBase allow doctors to submit reports of possible negative reactions to medications. Deep learning algorithms have been developed to parse these reports and detect patterns that imply drug-drug interactions. [ 42 ] Telemedicine [ edit ] An elderly man using a pulse oximeter to measure his blood oxygen levels The increase of telemedicine , the treatment of patients remotely, has shown the rise of possible AI applications. [ 43 ] AI can assist in caring for patients remotely by monitoring their information through sensors. [ 44 ] A wearable device may allow for constant monitoring of a patient and the ability to notice changes that may be less distinguishable by humans. The information can be compared to other data that has already been collected using artificial intelligence algorithms that alert physicians if there are any issues to be aware of. [ 44 ] Another application of artificial intelligence is chat-bot therapy. Some researchers charge that the reliance on chatbots for mental healthcare does not offer the reciprocity and accountability of care that should exist in the relationship between the consumer of mental healthcare and the care provider (be it a chat-bot or psychologist), though. [ 45 ] Some examples of these chatbots include Woebot, Earkick and Wysa. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Since the average age has risen due to a longer life expectancy, artificial intelligence could be useful in helping take care of older populations. [ 49 ] Tools such as environment and personal sensors can identify a person's regular activities and alert a caretaker if a behavior or a measured vital is abnormal. [ 49 ] Although the technology is useful, there are also discussions about limitations of monitoring in order to respect a person's privacy since there are technologies that are designed to map out home layouts and detect human interactions. [ 49 ] Workload management [ edit ] AI has the potential to streamline care coordination and reduce the workload. AI algorithms can automate administrative tasks, prioritize patient needs and facilitate seamless communication in a healthcare team. [ 50 ] This enables healthcare providers to focus more on direct patient care and ensures the efficient and coordinated delivery of healthcare services. Clinical applications [ edit ] Cardiovascular [ edit ] Artificial intelligence algorithms have shown promising results in accurately diagnosing and risk stratifying patients with concern for coronary artery disease, showing potential as an initial triage tool. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Other algorithms have been used in predicting patient mortality, medication effects, and adverse events following treatment for acute coronary syndrome . [ 51 ] Wearables, smartphones, and internet-based technologies have also shown the ability to monitor patients' cardiac data points, expanding the amount of data and the various settings AI models can use and potentially enabling earlier detection of cardiac events occurring outside of the hospital. [ 53 ] A research in 2019 found that AI can be used to predict heart attack with up to 90% accuracy. [ 54 ] Another growing area of research is the utility of AI in classifying heart sounds and diagnosing valvular disease . [ 55 ] Challenges of AI in cardiovascular medicine have included the limited data available to train machine learning models, such as limited data on social determinants of health as they pertain to cardiovascular disease . [ 56 ] A key limitation in early studies evaluating AI were omissions of data comparing algorithmic performance to humans. Examples of studies which assess AI performance relative to physicians includes how AI is non-inferior to humans in interpretation of cardiac echocardiograms [ 57 ] and that AI can diagnose heart attack better than human physicians in the emergency setting, reducing both low-value testing and missed diagnoses. [ 58 ] In cardiovascular tissue engineering and organoid studies, AI is increasingly used to analyze microscopy images, and integrate electrophysiological read outs. [ 59 ] Dermatology [ edit ] Medical imaging (such as X-ray and photography) is a commonly used tool in dermatology [ 60 ] and the development of deep learning has been strongly tied to image\u00a0processing . Therefore, there is a natural fit between the dermatology and deep learning. Machine learning learning holds great potential to process these images for better diagnoses. [ 61 ] Han et al. showed keratinocytic skin cancer detection from face photographs. [ 62 ] Esteva et al. demonstrated dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer from lesion images. [ 63 ] Noyan et al. demonstrated a convolutional neural network that achieved 94% accuracy at identifying skin cells from microscopic Tzanck smear images. [ 64 ] A concern raised with this work is that it has not engaged with disparities related to skin color or differential treatment of patients with non-white skin tones. [ 65 ] According to some researchers, AI algorithms have been shown to be more effective than dermatologists at identifying cancer. [ 66 ] However, a 2021 review article found that a majority of papers analyzing the performance of AI algorithms designed for skin cancer classification failed to use external test sets. [ 67 ] Only four research studies were found in which the AI algorithms were tested on clinics, regions, or populations distinct from those it was trained on, and in each of those four studies, the performance of dermatologists was found to be on par with that of the algorithm. Moreover, only one study [ 68 ] was set in the context of a full clinical examination; others were based on interaction through web-apps or online questionnaires, with most based entirely on context-free images of lesions. In this study, it was found that dermatologists significantly outperformed the algorithms. Many articles claiming superior performance of AI algorithms also fail to distinguish between trainees and board-certified dermatologists in their analyses. [ 67 ] It has also been suggested that AI could be used to automatically evaluate the outcome of maxillo-facial surgery or cleft palate therapy in regard to facial attractiveness or age appearance. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Gastroenterology [ edit ] AI can play a role in various facets of the field of gastroenterology . Endoscopic exams such as esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD) and colonoscopies rely on rapid detection of abnormal tissue. By enhancing these endoscopic procedures with AI, clinicians can more rapidly identify diseases, determine their severity, and visualize blind spots. Early trials in using AI detection systems of early stomach cancer have shown sensitivity close to expert endoscopists. [ 71 ] AI can assist doctors treating ulcerative colitis in detecting the microscopic activity of the disease in people and predicting when flare-ups will happen. For example, an AI-powered tool  was developed to analyse digitised bowel samples ( biopsies ). The tool was able to distinguish with 80% accuracy between samples that show remission of colitis and those with active disease. It also predicted the risk of a flare-up happening with the same accuracy. These rates of successfully using microscopic disease activity to predict disease flare are similar to the accuracy of pathologists . [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Obstetrics and gynaecology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence utilises massive amounts of data to help with predicting illness, prevention, and diagnosis, as well as patient monitoring. In obstetrics, artificial intelligence is utilized in magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and foetal cardiotocography. AI contributes in the resolution of a variety of obstetrical diagnostic issues. [ 74 ] Infectious diseases [ edit ] AI has shown potential in both the laboratory and clinical spheres of infectious disease medicine. [ 75 ] During the COVID-19 pandemic , AI has been used for early detection, tracking virus spread and analysing virus behaviour, among other things. [ 76 ] However, there were only a few examples of AI being used directly in clinical practice during the pandemic itself. [ 77 ] Other applications  of AI around infectious diseases include support-vector machines identifying antimicrobial resistance , machine learning analysis of blood smears to detect malaria , and improved point-of-care testing of Lyme disease based on antigen detection. Additionally, AI has been investigated for improving diagnosis of meningitis , sepsis , and tuberculosis , as well as predicting treatment complications in hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients. [ 75 ] Musculoskeletal [ edit ] AI has been used to identify causes of knee pain that doctors miss, that disproportionately affect Black patients. [ 78 ] Underserved populations experience higher levels of pain. These disparities persist even after controlling for the objective severity of diseases like osteoarthritis, as graded by human physicians using medical images, raising the possibility that underserved patients\u2019 pain stems from factors external to the knee, such as stress. Researchers have conducted a study using a machine-learning algorithm to show that standard radiographic measures of severity overlook objective but undiagnosed features that disproportionately affect diagnosis and management of underserved populations with knee pain. They proposed that new algorithmic measure ALG-P could potentially enable expanded access to treatments for underserved patients. [ 79 ] Neurology [ edit ] The use of AI technologies has been explored for use in the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For diagnostic purposes, machine learning models have been developed that rely on structural MRI inputs. [ 80 ] The input datasets for these models are drawn from databases such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. [ 81 ] Researchers have developed models that rely on convolutional neural networks with the aim of improving early diagnostic accuracy. [ 82 ] Generative adversarial networks are a form of deep learning that have also performed well in diagnosing AD. [ 83 ] There have also been efforts to develop machine learning models into forecasting tools that can predict the prognosis of patients with AD. Forecasting patient outcomes through generative models has been proposed by researchers as a means of synthesizing training and validation sets. [ 84 ] They suggest that generated patient forecasts could be used to provide future models larger training datasets than current open access databases. Oncology [ edit ] AI has been explored for use in cancer diagnosis, risk stratification, molecular characterization of tumors, and cancer drug discovery. A particular challenge in oncologic care that AI is being developed to address is the ability to accurately predict which treatment protocols will be best suited for each patient based on their individual genetic, molecular, and tumor-based characteristics. [ 85 ] AI has been trialed in cancer diagnostics with the reading of imaging studies and pathology slides. [ 86 ] In January 2020, Google DeepMind announced an algorithm capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer detection in screening scans. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] A number of researchers, including Trevor Hastie , Joelle Pineau , and Robert Tibshirani among others, published a reply claiming that DeepMind's research publication in Nature lacked key details on methodology and code, \"effectively undermin[ing] its scientific value\" and making it impossible for the scientific community to confirm the work. [ 89 ] In the MIT Technology Review , author Benjamin Haibe-Kains characterized DeepMind's work as \"an advertisement\" having little to do with science. [ 90 ] In July 2020, it was reported that an AI algorithm developed by the University of Pittsburgh achieves the highest accuracy to date in identifying prostate cancer , with 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] In 2023 a study reported the use of AI for CT -based radiomics classification at grading the aggressiveness of retroperitoneal sarcoma with 82% accuracy compared with 44% for lab analysis of biopsies. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Ophthalmology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence-enhanced technology is being used as an aid in the screening of eye disease and prevention of blindness. [ 95 ] In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the marketing of the first medical device to diagnose a specific type of eye disease, diabetic retinopathy using an artificial intelligence algorithm. [ 96 ] Moreover, AI technology may be used to further improve \"diagnosis rates\" because of the potential to decrease detection time. [ 97 ] Pathology [ edit ] Further information: Digital pathology Ki67 stain calculation by the open-source software QuPath in a pure seminoma, which gives a measure of the proliferation rate of the tumor. The colors represent the intensity of expression: blue-no expression, yellow-low, orange-moderate, and red-high expression. [ 98 ] For many diseases, pathological analysis of cells and tissues is considered to be the gold standard of disease diagnosis. Methods of digital pathology allows microscopy slides to be scanned and digitally analyzed. AI-assisted pathology tools have been developed to assist with the diagnosis of a number of diseases, including breast cancer, hepatitis B, gastric cancer , and colorectal cancer . AI has also been used to predict genetic mutations and prognosticate disease outcomes. [ 71 ] AI is well-suited for use in low-complexity pathological analysis of large-scale screening samples, such as colorectal or breast cancer screening, thus lessening the burden on pathologists and allowing for faster turnaround of sample analysis. [ 99 ] Several deep learning and artificial neural network models have shown accuracy similar to that of human pathologists, [ 99 ] and a study of deep learning assistance in diagnosing metastatic breast cancer in lymph nodes showed that the accuracy of humans with the assistance of a deep learning program was higher than either the humans alone or the AI program alone. [ 100 ] Additionally, implementation of digital pathology is predicted to save over $12 million for a university center over the course of five years, [ 101 ] though savings attributed to AI specifically have not yet been widely researched. The use of augmented and virtual reality could prove to be a stepping stone to wider implementation of AI-assisted pathology, as they can highlight areas of concern on a pathology sample and present them in real-time to a pathologist for more efficient review. [ 99 ] AI also has the potential to identify histological findings at levels beyond what the human eye can see, [ 99 ] and has shown the ability to use genotypic and phenotypic data to more accurately detect the tumor of origin for metastatic cancer. [ 102 ] One of the major current barriers to widespread implementation of AI-assisted pathology tools is the lack of prospective, randomized, multi-center controlled trials in determining the true clinical utility of AI for pathologists and patients, highlighting a current area of need in AI and healthcare research. [ 99 ] Primary care [ edit ] Primary care has become one key development area for AI technologies. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] AI in primary care has been used for supporting decision making, predictive modeling, and business analytics. [ 105 ] There are only a few examples of AI decision support systems that were prospectively assessed on clinical efficacy when used in practice by physicians. But there are cases where the use of these systems yielded a positive effect on treatment choice by physicians. [ 106 ] As of 2022 in relation to elder care, AI robots had been helpful in guiding older residents living in assisted living with entertainment and company. These bots are allowing staff in the home to have more one-on-one time with each resident, but the bots are also programmed with more ability in what they are able to do; such as knowing different languages and different types of care depending on the patient's conditions. The bot is an AI machine, which means it goes through the same training as any other machine - using algorithms to parse the given data, learn from it and predict the outcome in relation to what situation is at hand. [ 107 ] Psychiatry [ edit ] In psychiatry, AI applications are still in a phase of proof-of-concept. [ 108 ] Areas where the evidence is widening quickly include predictive modelling of diagnosis and treatment outcomes, [ 109 ] chatbots, conversational agents that imitate human behaviour and which have been studied for anxiety and depression. [ 110 ] Challenges include the fact that many applications in the field are developed and proposed by private corporations, such as the screening for suicidal ideation implemented by Facebook in 2017. [ 111 ] Such applications outside the healthcare system raise various professional, ethical and regulatory questions. [ 112 ] Another issue is often with the validity and interpretability of the models. Small training datasets contain bias that is inherited by the models, and compromises the generalizability and stability of these models. Such models may also have the potential to be discriminatory against minority groups that are underrepresented in samples. [ 113 ] In 2023, US-based National Eating Disorders Association replaced its human helpline staff with a chatbot but had to take it offline after users reported receiving harmful advice from it. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] Radiology [ edit ] AI is being studied within the field of radiology to detect and diagnose diseases through computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. [ 117 ] It may be particularly useful in settings where demand for human expertise exceeds supply, or where data is too complex to be efficiently interpreted by human readers. [ 118 ] Several deep learning models have shown the capability to be roughly as accurate as healthcare professionals in identifying diseases through medical imaging, though few of the studies reporting these findings have been externally validated. [ 119 ] AI can also provide non-interpretive benefit to radiologists, such as reducing noise in images, creating high-quality images from lower doses of radiation, enhancing MR image quality, [ 120 ] and automatically assessing image quality. [ 121 ] Further research investigating the use of AI in nuclear medicine focuses on image reconstruction, anatomical landmarking, and the enablement of lower doses in imaging studies. [ 122 ] The analysis of images for supervised AI applications in radiology encompasses two primary techniques at present: (1) convolutional neural network-based analysis; and (2) utilization of radiomics . [ 118 ] AI is also used in breast imaging for analyzing screening mammograms and can participate in improving breast cancer detection rate [ 123 ] as well as reducing radiologist's reading workload. Pharmacy [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Artificial intelligence in pharmacy . [ edit ] This article may require copy editing for grammar, style, cohesion, tone, or spelling . You can assist by editing it .

Artificial intelligence is playing a crucial role in driving the application and research in many fields and pharmacy is no exception. In pharmacy, the use of AI is leading to the discovery, development, and delivery of medications , and also enhancing patient care through personalized treatment plans. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] This article is going to summarize AI's application in drug research, drug safety, dose recommendation and examine the limitations and future directions of AI in pharmacy. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Industry [ edit ] The trend of large health companies merging allows for greater health data accessibility. Greater health data lays the groundwork for the implementation of AI algorithms. A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the clinical decision support systems . As more data is collected, machine learning algorithms adapt and allow for more robust responses and solutions. [ 117 ] Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of big data in the healthcare industry. Many companies investigate the market opportunities through the realms of \"data assessment, storage, management, and analysis technologies\" which are all crucial parts of the healthcare industry. [ 131 ] With the market for AI expanding constantly, large tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Baidu all have their own AI research divisions, as well as millions of dollars allocated for acquisition of smaller AI based companies. [ 131 ] The following are examples of large companies that are contributing to AI algorithms for use in healthcare: Amazon Web Services [ 132 ] Apple [ 132 ] Google 's DeepMind platform is being used by the UK National Health Service to detect certain health risks through data collected via a mobile app. A second project with the NHS involves the analysis of medical images collected from NHS patients to develop computer vision algorithms to detect cancerous tissues. IBM's Watson Oncology is in development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Cleveland Clinic . IBM is also working with CVS Health on AI applications in chronic disease treatment and with Johnson & Johnson on analysis of scientific papers to find new connections for drug development. In May 2017, IBM and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute began a joint project entitled Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning and Semantics (HEALS) , to explore using AI technology to enhance healthcare. Intel's venture capital arm Intel Capital invested in 2016 in the startup Lumiata, which uses AI to identify at-risk patients and develop care options. [ 133 ] Meta [ 132 ] Microsoft 's Hanover project, in partnership with Oregon Health & Science University 's Knight Cancer Institute, analyzes medical research to predict the most effective cancer drug treatment options for patients. Other projects include medical image analysis of tumor progression and the development of programmable cells. [ 134 ] Neuralink has come up with a next-generation neuroprosthetic which intricately interfaces with thousands of neural pathways in the brain. [ 117 ] Their process allows a chip, roughly the size of a quarter, to be inserted in the place of a chunk of a skull by a precision surgical robot to avoid accidental injury . [ 117 ] Elon Musk premiering the surgical robot that implants the Neuralink brain chip Ava Industries Ltd., a Canadian healthcare technology firm, is developing integrated AI tools to support clinical efficiency. Ava has implemented an embedded AI medical scribe within theis electronic medical record system (EMR) and is further developing tools such as an AI chart summarizer and an AI document classifier. [1] The company has received support through grants from Canada Health Infowayfor its work in advancing digital health solutions. [2] Tencent is working on several medical systems and services. These include AI Medical Innovation System (AIMIS) , an AI-powered diagnostic medical imaging service; WeChat Intelligent Healthcare; and Tencent Doctorwork Digital consultant apps use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user's medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution[ buzzword ] to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user (e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus) and value capturing mechanisms (e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders). IFlytek launched a service robot \"Xiao Man\", which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas. [ citation needed ] It also works in the field of medical imaging. Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH (\"Cruzr\") and Softbank Robotics (\"Pepper\"). [ citation needed ] The Indian startup Haptik developed a WhatsApp chatbot in 2021 which answers questions associated with the deadly coronavirus in India . Similarly, a software platform ChatBot in partnership with medtech startup Infermedica launched COVID-19 Risk Assessment ChatBot. [ 135 ] Many automobile manufacturers are beginning to use machine learning healthcare in their cars as well. [ 131 ] Companies such as BMW , GE , Tesla , Toyota , and Volvo all have new research campaigns to find ways of learning a driver's vital statistics to ensure they are awake, paying attention to the road, and not under the influence of substances. [ 131 ] Expanding care to developing nations [ edit ] Artificial intelligence continues to expand in its abilities to diagnose more people accurately in nations where fewer doctors are accessible to the public.\u00a0 Many new technology companies such as SpaceX and the Raspberry Pi Foundation have enabled more developing countries to have access to computers and the internet than ever before. [ 136 ] With the increasing capabilities of AI over the internet, advanced machine learning algorithms can allow patients to get accurately diagnosed when they would previously have no way of knowing if they had a life-threatening disease or not. [ 136 ] Using AI in developing nations that do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can improve patient care. AI can allow for not only diagnosis of patient in areas where healthcare is scarce, but also allow for a good patient experience by resourcing files to find the best treatment for a patient. [ 137 ] The ability of AI to adjust course as it goes also allows the patient to have their treatment modified based on what works for them; a level of individualized care that is nearly non-existent in developing countries. [ 137 ] Regulation [ edit ] This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( May 2025 ) Challenges of the clinical use of AI have brought about a potential need for regulations . AI studies need to be completely and transparently reported to have value to inform regulatory approval. Depending on the phase of study, international consensus-based reporting guidelines (TRIPOD+AI, [ 138 ] DECIDE-AI, [ 139 ] CONSORT-AI [ 140 ] ) have been developed to provide recommendations on the key details that need to be reported. A man speaking at the GDPR compliance workshop at the 2019 Entrepreneurship Summit While regulations exist pertaining to the collection of patient data such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the US ( HIPAA ) and the European General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) pertaining to patients within the EU, health care AI is \u201c\"severely under-regulated worldwide\" as of 2025. [ 132 ] Unclear is whether healthcare AI can be classified merely as software or as medical device . [ 132 ] United Nations (WHO/ITU) [ edit ] The joint ITU - WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H) has built a platform - known as the ITU-WHO AI for Health Framework - for the testing and benchmarking of AI applications in health domain. As of November 2018, eight use cases are being benchmarked, including assessing breast cancer risk from histopathological imagery, guiding anti-venom selection from snake images, and diagnosing skin lesions. USA [ edit ] United States Food & Drug Administration [ 141 ] In 2015, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued rules and regulations to protect the privacy of individuals\u2019 health information,  requiring healthcare providers to follow certain privacy rules when using AI, to keep a record of how they use AI and to ensure that their AI systems are secure. [ 142 ] In May 2016, the White House announced its plan to host a series of workshops and formation of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. [ citation needed ] In October 2016, the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, outlining its proposed priorities for Federally-funded AI research and development (within government and academia). The report notes a strategic R&D plan for the subfield of health information technology was in development stages. [ citation needed ] In January 2021, the US FDA published a new Action Plan, entitled Artificial Intelligence (AI) /Machine Learning (ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) Action Plan. [ 143 ] It layed out the FDA's future plans for regulation of medical devices that would include artificial intelligence in their software with five main actions: 1. Tailored Regulatory Framework for Ai/M:-based SaMD, 2. Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP), 3. Patient-Centered Approach Incorporating Transparency to Users, 4. Regulatory Science Methods Related to Algorithm Bias & Robustness, and 5. Real-World Performance(RWP). This plan was in direct response to stakeholders' feedback on a 2019 discussion paper also published by the FDA. [ 143 ] Under President Biden the DHSS and the National Institute of Standards and Technology were instructed to develop regulation of healthcare AI. [ 132 ] According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , the OCR issued guidance on the ethical use of AI in healthcare in 2021. It outlined four core ethical principles that must be followed: respect for autonomy , beneficence (ethics) , non-maleficence , and justice. Respect for autonomy requires that individuals have control over their own data and decisions. Beneficence requires that AI be used to do good, such as improving the quality of care and reducing health disparities. Non-maleficence requires that AI be used to do no harm, such as avoiding discrimination in decisions. Finally, justice requires that AI be used fairly, such as using the same standards for decisions no matter a person's race, gender, or income level. As of March 2021, the OCR had hired a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (OCAIO) to pursue the \"implementation of the HHS AI strategy\". [ 144 ] With the second Trump administration deregulation of health AI began on January 20, 2025 with merely voluntary standards for collecting and sharing data, statutory definitions for algorithmic discrimination, automation bias, and equity being cancelled, cuts to NIST and 19% of FDA workforce eliminated. [ 132 ] Europe [ edit ] Other countries have implemented data protection regulations, more specifically with company privacy invasions. In Denmark, the Danish Expert Group on data ethics has adopted recommendations on 'Data for the Benefit of the People'. These recommendations are intended to encourage the responsible use of data in the business sector, with a focus on data processing. The recommendations include a focus on equality and non-discrimination with regard to bias in AI, as well as human dignity which is to outweigh profit and must be respected in all data processes. [ 145 ] The European Union has implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect citizens' personal data, which applies to the use of AI in healthcare. In addition, the European Commission has established guidelines to ensure the ethical development of AI, including the use of algorithms to ensure fairness and transparency. [ 146 ] With GDPR, the European Union was the first to regulate AI through data protection legislation. The Union finds privacy as a fundamental human right, it wants to prevent unconsented and secondary uses of data by private or public health facilities. By streamlining access to personal data for health research and findings, they are able to instate the right and importance of patient privacy. [ 146 ] In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires organizations to protect the privacy and security of patient information. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have also released guidelines for the development of AI-based medical applications. [ 147 ] In 2025, Europe was leading the USA on AI regulation, while lagging in innovation and at least one California-based biotech company was \"engaging the European Medicines Agency earlier in development than previously anticipated to mitigate concerns about the FDA's ability to meet development timelines.\" [ 132 ] Ethical concerns [ edit ] While research on the use of AI in healthcare aims to validate its efficacy in improving patient outcomes before its broader adoption, its use may introduce several new types of risk to patients and healthcare providers, such as algorithmic bias , Do not resuscitate implications, and other machine morality issues. AI may also compromise the protection of patients' rights, such as the right to informed consent and the right to medical data protection. [ 148 ] Data collection, privacy - autonomy [ edit ] In order to effectively train Machine Learning and use AI in healthcare, massive amounts of data must be gathered. Acquiring this data, however, comes at the cost of patient privacy , i.e. autonomy in most cases and is not well received publicly. For example, a survey conducted in the UK estimated that 63% of the population is uncomfortable with sharing their personal data in order to improve artificial intelligence technology. [ 149 ] The scarcity of real, accessible patient data is a hindrance that deters the progress of developing and deploying more artificial intelligence in healthcare. The lack of regulations surrounding AI in the United States has generated concerns about mismanagement of patient data, such as with corporations utilizing patient data for financial gain. For example, as of 2020 Roche , a Swiss healthcare company, was found to have purchased healthcare data for approximately 2 million cancer patients at an estimated total cost of $1.9 billion. [ 150 ] Naturally, this generates questions of ethical concern; Is there a monetary price that can be set for data, and should it depend on its perceived value or contributions to science? Is it fair to patients to sell their data? These concerns were addressed in a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2022 that asked Americans for their opinions about the increased presence of AI in their daily lives, and the survey estimated that 37% of Americans were more concerned than excited about such increased presence, with 8% of participants specifically associating their concern with \"people misusing AI\". [ 151 ] Ultimately, the current potential of artificial intelligence in healthcare is additionally hindered by  concerns about mismanagement of data collected, especially in the United States. Automation- beneficence [ edit ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic , or fulfill beneficence . [ 16 ] According to a 2019 study, AI can replace up to 35% of jobs in the UK within the next 10 to 20 years. [ 152 ] However, of these jobs, it was concluded that AI has not eliminated any healthcare jobs so far. Though if AI were to automate healthcare-related jobs, the jobs most susceptible to automation would be those dealing with digital information, radiology, and pathology, as opposed to those dealing with doctor-to-patient interaction. [ 152 ] Ouutputs can be incorrect or incomplete and diagnosis and recommendations harm people. [ 132 ] Bias, discrimination [ edit ] Since AI makes decisions solely on the data it receives as input, it is important that this data represents accurate patient demographics. In a hospital setting, patients do not have full knowledge of how predictive algorithms are created or calibrated. Therefore, these medical establishments can unfairly code their algorithms to discriminate against minorities and prioritize profits rather than providing optimal care, i.e. violating the ethical principle of social justice or non-maleficence . [ 153 ] A recent scoping review identified 18 equity challenges along with 15 strategies that can be implemented to help address them when AI applications are developed using many-to-many mapping. [ 154 ] There can be unintended bias in algorithms that can exacerbate social and healthcare inequities. [ 153 ] Since AI's decisions are a direct reflection of its input data, the data it receives must have accurate representation of patient demographics. For instance, if populations are less represented in healthcare data it is likely to create bias in AI tools that lead to incorrect assumptions of a demographic and impact the ability to provide appropriate care. [ 155 ] White males are overly represented in medical data sets. [ 156 ] Therefore, having minimal patient data on minorities can lead to AI making more accurate predictions for majority populations, leading to unintended worse medical outcomes for minority populations. [ 157 ] Collecting data from minority communities can also lead to medical discrimination. For instance, HIV is a prevalent virus among minority communities and HIV status can be used to discriminate against patients. [ 156 ] In addition to biases that may arise from sample selection, different clinical systems used to collect data may also impact AI functionality. For example, radiographic systems and their outcomes (e.g., resolution) vary by provider. Moreover, clinician work practices, such as the positioning of the patient for radiography, can also greatly influence the data and make comparability difficult. [ 158 ] However, these biases are able to be eliminated through careful implementation and a methodical collection of representative data. A final source of algorithmic bias , which has been called \"label choice bias\", arises when proxy measures are used to train algorithms, that build in bias against certain groups. For example, a widely used algorithm predicted health care costs as a proxy for health care needs, and used predictions to allocate resources to help patients with complex health needs. This introduced bias because Black patients have lower costs, even when they are just as unhealthy as White patients. [ 159 ] Solutions to the \"label choice bias\" aim to match the actual target (what the algorithm is predicting) more closely to the ideal target (what researchers want the algorithm to predict), so for the prior example, instead of predicting cost, researchers would focus on the variable of healthcare needs which is rather more significant. Adjusting the target led to almost double the number of Black patients being selected for the program. History [ edit ] Research in the 1960s and 1970s produced the first problem-solving program, or expert system , known as Dendral . [ 160 ] [ 161 ] While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry, it provided the basis for a subsequent system MYCIN , [ 162 ] considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine. [ 162 ] [ 163 ] MYCIN and other systems such as INTERNIST-1 and CASNET did not achieve routine use by practitioners, however. [ 164 ] The 1980s and 1990s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity. During this time, there was a recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physicians. [ 165 ] Approaches involving fuzzy set theory, [ 166 ] Bayesian networks , [ 167 ] and artificial neural networks , [ 168 ] [ 169 ] have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare. Medical and technological advancements occurring over this half-century period that have enabled the growth of healthcare-related applications of AI to include: Improvements in computing power resulting in faster data collection and data processing [ 170 ] Growth of genomic sequencing databases [ 171 ] Widespread implementation of electronic health record systems [ 172 ] Improvements in natural language processing and computer vision , enabling machines to replicate human perceptual processes [ 173 ] [ 174 ] Enhanced the precision of robot-assisted surgery [ 175 ] Increased tree-based machine learning models that allow flexibility in establishing health predictors [ 176 ] Improvements in deep learning techniques and data logs for rare diseases See also [ edit ] AI alignment Artificial intelligence in mental health Artificial intelligence Glossary of artificial intelligence Full body scanner (i.e. Dermascanner , ...)

In some cases, it can exceed or augment human capabilities by providing better or faster ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] As the widespread use of AI in healthcare is still relatively new, research is ongoing into its applications across various medical subdisciplines and related industries. AI programs are being applied to practices such as diagnostics , [ 4 ] treatment protocol development, [ 5 ] drug development , [ 6 ] personalized medicine , [ 7 ] and patient monitoring and care. [ 8 ] Since radiographs are the most commonly performed imaging tests in radiology, the potential for AI to assist with triage and interpretation of radiographs is particularly significant. [ 9 ] Using AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy , automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing biases . [ 10 ] Furthermore, new technologies such as AI are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption. [ 11 ] In contrast, there are also several cases where AI has been put to use in healthcare without proper testing. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic. [ 16 ] Moreover, meta-studies have found that the scientific literature on AI in healthcare often suffers from a lack of reproducibility . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Applications in healthcare systems [ edit ] Disease diagnosis [ edit ] Accurate and early diagnosis of diseases is still a challenge in healthcare. Recognizing medical conditions and their symptoms is a complex problem. AI can assist clinicians with its data processing capabilities to save time and improve accuracy. [ 21 ] Through the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence can be able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the analysis of mass electronic health records (EHRs). [ 22 ] AI can help early prediction, for example, of Alzheimer's disease and dementias , by looking through large numbers of similar cases and possible treatments. [ 23 ] AI can aid doctors' decision-making in emergency cases, for example, in emergency departments. AI algorithms may assist in prioritizing critical cases, cutting down waiting times. Also, AI-backed decision support systems make recommendations instantly and enable quicker interpretation of data, which supports healthcare professionals' decisions. [ 21 ] In 2023 a study reported higher satisfaction rates with ChatGPT -generated responses compared with those from physicians for medical questions posted on Reddit \u2019s r/AskDocs. [ 24 ] Evaluators preferred ChatGPT's responses to physician responses in 78.6% of 585 evaluations, noting better quality and empathy. The authors noted that these were isolated questions taken from an online forum, not in the context of an established patient-physician relationship. [ 24 ] Moreover, responses were not graded on the accuracy of medical information, and some have argued that the experiment was not properly blinded , with the evaluators being coauthors of the study. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Recent developments in statistical physics , machine learning , and inference algorithms are also being explored for their potential in improving medical diagnostic approaches. [ 28 ] Also, the establishment of large healthcare-related data warehouses of sometimes hundreds of millions of patients provides extensive training data for AI models. [ 29 ] Electronic health records [ edit ] Electronic health records (EHR) are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. Now that around 80% of medical practices use EHR, some anticipate the use of artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians. [ 30 ] One application uses natural language processing (NLP) to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms. [ 30 ] For example, the term heart attack and myocardial infarction mean the same things, but physicians may use one over the other based on personal preferences. [ 30 ] NLP algorithms consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed. [ 30 ] Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician's notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read. [ 30 ] Other applications use concept processing to analyze the information entered by the current patient's doctor to present similar cases and help the physician remember to include all relevant details. [ 31 ] Beyond making content edits to an EHR, there are AI algorithms that evaluate an individual patient's record and predict a risk for a disease based on their previous information and family history. [ 32 ] One general algorithm is a rule-based system that makes decisions similarly to how humans use flow charts. [ 33 ] This system takes in large amounts of data and creates a set of rules that connect specific observations to concluded diagnoses. [ 33 ] Thus, the algorithm can take in a new patient's data and try to predict the likeliness that they will have a certain condition or disease. [ 33 ] Since the algorithms can evaluate a patient's information based on collective data, they can find any outstanding issues to bring to a physician's attention and save time. [ 32 ] One study conducted by the Centerstone research institute found that predictive modeling of EHR data has achieved 70\u201372% accuracy in predicting individualized treatment response. [ 34 ] These methods are helpful due to the fact that the amount of online health records doubles every five years. [ 32 ] Physicians do not have the bandwidth to process all this data manually, and AI can leverage this data to assist physicians in treating their patients. [ 32 ] Drug interactions [ edit ] Improvements in natural language processing led to the development of algorithms to identify drug-drug interactions in medical literature. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Drug-drug interactions pose a threat to those taking multiple medications simultaneously, and the danger increases with the number of medications being taken. [ 39 ] To address the difficulty of tracking all known or suspected drug-drug interactions, machine learning algorithms have been created to extract information on interacting drugs and their possible effects from medical literature. Efforts were consolidated in 2013 in the DDIExtraction Challenge, in which a team of researchers at Carlos III University assembled a corpus of literature on drug-drug interactions to form a standardized test for such algorithms. [ 40 ] Competitors were tested on their ability to accurately determine, from the text, which drugs were shown to interact and what the characteristics of their interactions were. [ 41 ] Researchers continue to use this corpus to standardize the measurement of the effectiveness of their algorithms. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 38 ] Other algorithms identify drug-drug interactions from patterns in user-generated content , especially electronic health records and/or adverse event reports. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Organizations such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the World Health Organization's VigiBase allow doctors to submit reports of possible negative reactions to medications. Deep learning algorithms have been developed to parse these reports and detect patterns that imply drug-drug interactions. [ 42 ] Telemedicine [ edit ] An elderly man using a pulse oximeter to measure his blood oxygen levels The increase of telemedicine , the treatment of patients remotely, has shown the rise of possible AI applications. [ 43 ] AI can assist in caring for patients remotely by monitoring their information through sensors. [ 44 ] A wearable device may allow for constant monitoring of a patient and the ability to notice changes that may be less distinguishable by humans. The information can be compared to other data that has already been collected using artificial intelligence algorithms that alert physicians if there are any issues to be aware of. [ 44 ] Another application of artificial intelligence is chat-bot therapy. Some researchers charge that the reliance on chatbots for mental healthcare does not offer the reciprocity and accountability of care that should exist in the relationship between the consumer of mental healthcare and the care provider (be it a chat-bot or psychologist), though. [ 45 ] Some examples of these chatbots include Woebot, Earkick and Wysa. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Since the average age has risen due to a longer life expectancy, artificial intelligence could be useful in helping take care of older populations. [ 49 ] Tools such as environment and personal sensors can identify a person's regular activities and alert a caretaker if a behavior or a measured vital is abnormal. [ 49 ] Although the technology is useful, there are also discussions about limitations of monitoring in order to respect a person's privacy since there are technologies that are designed to map out home layouts and detect human interactions. [ 49 ] Workload management [ edit ] AI has the potential to streamline care coordination and reduce the workload. AI algorithms can automate administrative tasks, prioritize patient needs and facilitate seamless communication in a healthcare team. [ 50 ] This enables healthcare providers to focus more on direct patient care and ensures the efficient and coordinated delivery of healthcare services. Clinical applications [ edit ] Cardiovascular [ edit ] Artificial intelligence algorithms have shown promising results in accurately diagnosing and risk stratifying patients with concern for coronary artery disease, showing potential as an initial triage tool. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Other algorithms have been used in predicting patient mortality, medication effects, and adverse events following treatment for acute coronary syndrome . [ 51 ] Wearables, smartphones, and internet-based technologies have also shown the ability to monitor patients' cardiac data points, expanding the amount of data and the various settings AI models can use and potentially enabling earlier detection of cardiac events occurring outside of the hospital. [ 53 ] A research in 2019 found that AI can be used to predict heart attack with up to 90% accuracy. [ 54 ] Another growing area of research is the utility of AI in classifying heart sounds and diagnosing valvular disease . [ 55 ] Challenges of AI in cardiovascular medicine have included the limited data available to train machine learning models, such as limited data on social determinants of health as they pertain to cardiovascular disease . [ 56 ] A key limitation in early studies evaluating AI were omissions of data comparing algorithmic performance to humans. Examples of studies which assess AI performance relative to physicians includes how AI is non-inferior to humans in interpretation of cardiac echocardiograms [ 57 ] and that AI can diagnose heart attack better than human physicians in the emergency setting, reducing both low-value testing and missed diagnoses. [ 58 ] In cardiovascular tissue engineering and organoid studies, AI is increasingly used to analyze microscopy images, and integrate electrophysiological read outs. [ 59 ] Dermatology [ edit ] Medical imaging (such as X-ray and photography) is a commonly used tool in dermatology [ 60 ] and the development of deep learning has been strongly tied to image\u00a0processing . Therefore, there is a natural fit between the dermatology and deep learning. Machine learning learning holds great potential to process these images for better diagnoses. [ 61 ] Han et al. showed keratinocytic skin cancer detection from face photographs. [ 62 ] Esteva et al. demonstrated dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer from lesion images. [ 63 ] Noyan et al. demonstrated a convolutional neural network that achieved 94% accuracy at identifying skin cells from microscopic Tzanck smear images. [ 64 ] A concern raised with this work is that it has not engaged with disparities related to skin color or differential treatment of patients with non-white skin tones. [ 65 ] According to some researchers, AI algorithms have been shown to be more effective than dermatologists at identifying cancer. [ 66 ] However, a 2021 review article found that a majority of papers analyzing the performance of AI algorithms designed for skin cancer classification failed to use external test sets. [ 67 ] Only four research studies were found in which the AI algorithms were tested on clinics, regions, or populations distinct from those it was trained on, and in each of those four studies, the performance of dermatologists was found to be on par with that of the algorithm. Moreover, only one study [ 68 ] was set in the context of a full clinical examination; others were based on interaction through web-apps or online questionnaires, with most based entirely on context-free images of lesions. In this study, it was found that dermatologists significantly outperformed the algorithms. Many articles claiming superior performance of AI algorithms also fail to distinguish between trainees and board-certified dermatologists in their analyses. [ 67 ] It has also been suggested that AI could be used to automatically evaluate the outcome of maxillo-facial surgery or cleft palate therapy in regard to facial attractiveness or age appearance. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Gastroenterology [ edit ] AI can play a role in various facets of the field of gastroenterology . Endoscopic exams such as esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD) and colonoscopies rely on rapid detection of abnormal tissue. By enhancing these endoscopic procedures with AI, clinicians can more rapidly identify diseases, determine their severity, and visualize blind spots. Early trials in using AI detection systems of early stomach cancer have shown sensitivity close to expert endoscopists. [ 71 ] AI can assist doctors treating ulcerative colitis in detecting the microscopic activity of the disease in people and predicting when flare-ups will happen. For example, an AI-powered tool  was developed to analyse digitised bowel samples ( biopsies ). The tool was able to distinguish with 80% accuracy between samples that show remission of colitis and those with active disease. It also predicted the risk of a flare-up happening with the same accuracy. These rates of successfully using microscopic disease activity to predict disease flare are similar to the accuracy of pathologists . [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Obstetrics and gynaecology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence utilises massive amounts of data to help with predicting illness, prevention, and diagnosis, as well as patient monitoring. In obstetrics, artificial intelligence is utilized in magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and foetal cardiotocography. AI contributes in the resolution of a variety of obstetrical diagnostic issues. [ 74 ] Infectious diseases [ edit ] AI has shown potential in both the laboratory and clinical spheres of infectious disease medicine. [ 75 ] During the COVID-19 pandemic , AI has been used for early detection, tracking virus spread and analysing virus behaviour, among other things. [ 76 ] However, there were only a few examples of AI being used directly in clinical practice during the pandemic itself. [ 77 ] Other applications  of AI around infectious diseases include support-vector machines identifying antimicrobial resistance , machine learning analysis of blood smears to detect malaria , and improved point-of-care testing of Lyme disease based on antigen detection. Additionally, AI has been investigated for improving diagnosis of meningitis , sepsis , and tuberculosis , as well as predicting treatment complications in hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients. [ 75 ] Musculoskeletal [ edit ] AI has been used to identify causes of knee pain that doctors miss, that disproportionately affect Black patients. [ 78 ] Underserved populations experience higher levels of pain. These disparities persist even after controlling for the objective severity of diseases like osteoarthritis, as graded by human physicians using medical images, raising the possibility that underserved patients\u2019 pain stems from factors external to the knee, such as stress. Researchers have conducted a study using a machine-learning algorithm to show that standard radiographic measures of severity overlook objective but undiagnosed features that disproportionately affect diagnosis and management of underserved populations with knee pain. They proposed that new algorithmic measure ALG-P could potentially enable expanded access to treatments for underserved patients. [ 79 ] Neurology [ edit ] The use of AI technologies has been explored for use in the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For diagnostic purposes, machine learning models have been developed that rely on structural MRI inputs. [ 80 ] The input datasets for these models are drawn from databases such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. [ 81 ] Researchers have developed models that rely on convolutional neural networks with the aim of improving early diagnostic accuracy. [ 82 ] Generative adversarial networks are a form of deep learning that have also performed well in diagnosing AD. [ 83 ] There have also been efforts to develop machine learning models into forecasting tools that can predict the prognosis of patients with AD. Forecasting patient outcomes through generative models has been proposed by researchers as a means of synthesizing training and validation sets. [ 84 ] They suggest that generated patient forecasts could be used to provide future models larger training datasets than current open access databases. Oncology [ edit ] AI has been explored for use in cancer diagnosis, risk stratification, molecular characterization of tumors, and cancer drug discovery. A particular challenge in oncologic care that AI is being developed to address is the ability to accurately predict which treatment protocols will be best suited for each patient based on their individual genetic, molecular, and tumor-based characteristics. [ 85 ] AI has been trialed in cancer diagnostics with the reading of imaging studies and pathology slides. [ 86 ] In January 2020, Google DeepMind announced an algorithm capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer detection in screening scans. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] A number of researchers, including Trevor Hastie , Joelle Pineau , and Robert Tibshirani among others, published a reply claiming that DeepMind's research publication in Nature lacked key details on methodology and code, \"effectively undermin[ing] its scientific value\" and making it impossible for the scientific community to confirm the work. [ 89 ] In the MIT Technology Review , author Benjamin Haibe-Kains characterized DeepMind's work as \"an advertisement\" having little to do with science. [ 90 ] In July 2020, it was reported that an AI algorithm developed by the University of Pittsburgh achieves the highest accuracy to date in identifying prostate cancer , with 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] In 2023 a study reported the use of AI for CT -based radiomics classification at grading the aggressiveness of retroperitoneal sarcoma with 82% accuracy compared with 44% for lab analysis of biopsies. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Ophthalmology [ edit ] Artificial intelligence-enhanced technology is being used as an aid in the screening of eye disease and prevention of blindness. [ 95 ] In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the marketing of the first medical device to diagnose a specific type of eye disease, diabetic retinopathy using an artificial intelligence algorithm. [ 96 ] Moreover, AI technology may be used to further improve \"diagnosis rates\" because of the potential to decrease detection time. [ 97 ] Pathology [ edit ] Further information: Digital pathology Ki67 stain calculation by the open-source software QuPath in a pure seminoma, which gives a measure of the proliferation rate of the tumor. The colors represent the intensity of expression: blue-no expression, yellow-low, orange-moderate, and red-high expression. [ 98 ] For many diseases, pathological analysis of cells and tissues is considered to be the gold standard of disease diagnosis. Methods of digital pathology allows microscopy slides to be scanned and digitally analyzed. AI-assisted pathology tools have been developed to assist with the diagnosis of a number of diseases, including breast cancer, hepatitis B, gastric cancer , and colorectal cancer . AI has also been used to predict genetic mutations and prognosticate disease outcomes. [ 71 ] AI is well-suited for use in low-complexity pathological analysis of large-scale screening samples, such as colorectal or breast cancer screening, thus lessening the burden on pathologists and allowing for faster turnaround of sample analysis. [ 99 ] Several deep learning and artificial neural network models have shown accuracy similar to that of human pathologists, [ 99 ] and a study of deep learning assistance in diagnosing metastatic breast cancer in lymph nodes showed that the accuracy of humans with the assistance of a deep learning program was higher than either the humans alone or the AI program alone. [ 100 ] Additionally, implementation of digital pathology is predicted to save over $12 million for a university center over the course of five years, [ 101 ] though savings attributed to AI specifically have not yet been widely researched. The use of augmented and virtual reality could prove to be a stepping stone to wider implementation of AI-assisted pathology, as they can highlight areas of concern on a pathology sample and present them in real-time to a pathologist for more efficient review. [ 99 ] AI also has the potential to identify histological findings at levels beyond what the human eye can see, [ 99 ] and has shown the ability to use genotypic and phenotypic data to more accurately detect the tumor of origin for metastatic cancer. [ 102 ] One of the major current barriers to widespread implementation of AI-assisted pathology tools is the lack of prospective, randomized, multi-center controlled trials in determining the true clinical utility of AI for pathologists and patients, highlighting a current area of need in AI and healthcare research. [ 99 ] Primary care [ edit ] Primary care has become one key development area for AI technologies. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] AI in primary care has been used for supporting decision making, predictive modeling, and business analytics. [ 105 ] There are only a few examples of AI decision support systems that were prospectively assessed on clinical efficacy when used in practice by physicians. But there are cases where the use of these systems yielded a positive effect on treatment choice by physicians. [ 106 ] As of 2022 in relation to elder care, AI robots had been helpful in guiding older residents living in assisted living with entertainment and company. These bots are allowing staff in the home to have more one-on-one time with each resident, but the bots are also programmed with more ability in what they are able to do; such as knowing different languages and different types of care depending on the patient's conditions. The bot is an AI machine, which means it goes through the same training as any other machine - using algorithms to parse the given data, learn from it and predict the outcome in relation to what situation is at hand. [ 107 ] Psychiatry [ edit ] In psychiatry, AI applications are still in a phase of proof-of-concept. [ 108 ] Areas where the evidence is widening quickly include predictive modelling of diagnosis and treatment outcomes, [ 109 ] chatbots, conversational agents that imitate human behaviour and which have been studied for anxiety and depression. [ 110 ] Challenges include the fact that many applications in the field are developed and proposed by private corporations, such as the screening for suicidal ideation implemented by Facebook in 2017. [ 111 ] Such applications outside the healthcare system raise various professional, ethical and regulatory questions. [ 112 ] Another issue is often with the validity and interpretability of the models. Small training datasets contain bias that is inherited by the models, and compromises the generalizability and stability of these models. Such models may also have the potential to be discriminatory against minority groups that are underrepresented in samples. [ 113 ] In 2023, US-based National Eating Disorders Association replaced its human helpline staff with a chatbot but had to take it offline after users reported receiving harmful advice from it. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] Radiology [ edit ] AI is being studied within the field of radiology to detect and diagnose diseases through computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. [ 117 ] It may be particularly useful in settings where demand for human expertise exceeds supply, or where data is too complex to be efficiently interpreted by human readers. [ 118 ] Several deep learning models have shown the capability to be roughly as accurate as healthcare professionals in identifying diseases through medical imaging, though few of the studies reporting these findings have been externally validated. [ 119 ] AI can also provide non-interpretive benefit to radiologists, such as reducing noise in images, creating high-quality images from lower doses of radiation, enhancing MR image quality, [ 120 ] and automatically assessing image quality. [ 121 ] Further research investigating the use of AI in nuclear medicine focuses on image reconstruction, anatomical landmarking, and the enablement of lower doses in imaging studies. [ 122 ] The analysis of images for supervised AI applications in radiology encompasses two primary techniques at present: (1) convolutional neural network-based analysis; and (2) utilization of radiomics . [ 118 ] AI is also used in breast imaging for analyzing screening mammograms and can participate in improving breast cancer detection rate [ 123 ] as well as reducing radiologist's reading workload.

Artificial intelligence is playing a crucial role in driving the application and research in many fields and pharmacy is no exception. In pharmacy, the use of AI is leading to the discovery, development, and delivery of medications , and also enhancing patient care through personalized treatment plans. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] This article is going to summarize AI's application in drug research, drug safety, dose recommendation and examine the limitations and future directions of AI in pharmacy. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Industry [ edit ] The trend of large health companies merging allows for greater health data accessibility. Greater health data lays the groundwork for the implementation of AI algorithms. A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the clinical decision support systems . As more data is collected, machine learning algorithms adapt and allow for more robust responses and solutions. [ 117 ] Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of big data in the healthcare industry. Many companies investigate the market opportunities through the realms of \"data assessment, storage, management, and analysis technologies\" which are all crucial parts of the healthcare industry. [ 131 ] With the market for AI expanding constantly, large tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Baidu all have their own AI research divisions, as well as millions of dollars allocated for acquisition of smaller AI based companies. [ 131 ] The following are examples of large companies that are contributing to AI algorithms for use in healthcare: Amazon Web Services [ 132 ] Apple [ 132 ] Google 's DeepMind platform is being used by the UK National Health Service to detect certain health risks through data collected via a mobile app. A second project with the NHS involves the analysis of medical images collected from NHS patients to develop computer vision algorithms to detect cancerous tissues. IBM's Watson Oncology is in development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Cleveland Clinic . IBM is also working with CVS Health on AI applications in chronic disease treatment and with Johnson & Johnson on analysis of scientific papers to find new connections for drug development. In May 2017, IBM and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute began a joint project entitled Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning and Semantics (HEALS) , to explore using AI technology to enhance healthcare. Intel's venture capital arm Intel Capital invested in 2016 in the startup Lumiata, which uses AI to identify at-risk patients and develop care options. [ 133 ] Meta [ 132 ] Microsoft 's Hanover project, in partnership with Oregon Health & Science University 's Knight Cancer Institute, analyzes medical research to predict the most effective cancer drug treatment options for patients. Other projects include medical image analysis of tumor progression and the development of programmable cells. [ 134 ] Neuralink has come up with a next-generation neuroprosthetic which intricately interfaces with thousands of neural pathways in the brain. [ 117 ] Their process allows a chip, roughly the size of a quarter, to be inserted in the place of a chunk of a skull by a precision surgical robot to avoid accidental injury . [ 117 ] Elon Musk premiering the surgical robot that implants the Neuralink brain chip Ava Industries Ltd., a Canadian healthcare technology firm, is developing integrated AI tools to support clinical efficiency. Ava has implemented an embedded AI medical scribe within theis electronic medical record system (EMR) and is further developing tools such as an AI chart summarizer and an AI document classifier. [1] The company has received support through grants from Canada Health Infowayfor its work in advancing digital health solutions. [2] Tencent is working on several medical systems and services. These include AI Medical Innovation System (AIMIS) , an AI-powered diagnostic medical imaging service; WeChat Intelligent Healthcare; and Tencent Doctorwork Digital consultant apps use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user's medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution[ buzzword ] to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user (e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus) and value capturing mechanisms (e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders). IFlytek launched a service robot \"Xiao Man\", which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas. [ citation needed ] It also works in the field of medical imaging. Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH (\"Cruzr\") and Softbank Robotics (\"Pepper\"). [ citation needed ] The Indian startup Haptik developed a WhatsApp chatbot in 2021 which answers questions associated with the deadly coronavirus in India . Similarly, a software platform ChatBot in partnership with medtech startup Infermedica launched COVID-19 Risk Assessment ChatBot. [ 135 ] Many automobile manufacturers are beginning to use machine learning healthcare in their cars as well. [ 131 ] Companies such as BMW , GE , Tesla , Toyota , and Volvo all have new research campaigns to find ways of learning a driver's vital statistics to ensure they are awake, paying attention to the road, and not under the influence of substances. [ 131 ] Expanding care to developing nations [ edit ] Artificial intelligence continues to expand in its abilities to diagnose more people accurately in nations where fewer doctors are accessible to the public.\u00a0 Many new technology companies such as SpaceX and the Raspberry Pi Foundation have enabled more developing countries to have access to computers and the internet than ever before. [ 136 ] With the increasing capabilities of AI over the internet, advanced machine learning algorithms can allow patients to get accurately diagnosed when they would previously have no way of knowing if they had a life-threatening disease or not. [ 136 ] Using AI in developing nations that do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can improve patient care. AI can allow for not only diagnosis of patient in areas where healthcare is scarce, but also allow for a good patient experience by resourcing files to find the best treatment for a patient. [ 137 ] The ability of AI to adjust course as it goes also allows the patient to have their treatment modified based on what works for them; a level of individualized care that is nearly non-existent in developing countries. [ 137 ] Regulation [ edit ] This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( May 2025 ) Challenges of the clinical use of AI have brought about a potential need for regulations . AI studies need to be completely and transparently reported to have value to inform regulatory approval. Depending on the phase of study, international consensus-based reporting guidelines (TRIPOD+AI, [ 138 ] DECIDE-AI, [ 139 ] CONSORT-AI [ 140 ] ) have been developed to provide recommendations on the key details that need to be reported. A man speaking at the GDPR compliance workshop at the 2019 Entrepreneurship Summit While regulations exist pertaining to the collection of patient data such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the US ( HIPAA ) and the European General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) pertaining to patients within the EU, health care AI is \u201c\"severely under-regulated worldwide\" as of 2025. [ 132 ] Unclear is whether healthcare AI can be classified merely as software or as medical device . [ 132 ] United Nations (WHO/ITU) [ edit ] The joint ITU - WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H) has built a platform - known as the ITU-WHO AI for Health Framework - for the testing and benchmarking of AI applications in health domain. As of November 2018, eight use cases are being benchmarked, including assessing breast cancer risk from histopathological imagery, guiding anti-venom selection from snake images, and diagnosing skin lesions. USA [ edit ] United States Food & Drug Administration [ 141 ] In 2015, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued rules and regulations to protect the privacy of individuals\u2019 health information,  requiring healthcare providers to follow certain privacy rules when using AI, to keep a record of how they use AI and to ensure that their AI systems are secure. [ 142 ] In May 2016, the White House announced its plan to host a series of workshops and formation of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. [ citation needed ] In October 2016, the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, outlining its proposed priorities for Federally-funded AI research and development (within government and academia). The report notes a strategic R&D plan for the subfield of health information technology was in development stages. [ citation needed ] In January 2021, the US FDA published a new Action Plan, entitled Artificial Intelligence (AI) /Machine Learning (ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) Action Plan. [ 143 ] It layed out the FDA's future plans for regulation of medical devices that would include artificial intelligence in their software with five main actions: 1. Tailored Regulatory Framework for Ai/M:-based SaMD, 2. Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP), 3. Patient-Centered Approach Incorporating Transparency to Users, 4. Regulatory Science Methods Related to Algorithm Bias & Robustness, and 5. Real-World Performance(RWP). This plan was in direct response to stakeholders' feedback on a 2019 discussion paper also published by the FDA. [ 143 ] Under President Biden the DHSS and the National Institute of Standards and Technology were instructed to develop regulation of healthcare AI. [ 132 ] According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , the OCR issued guidance on the ethical use of AI in healthcare in 2021. It outlined four core ethical principles that must be followed: respect for autonomy , beneficence (ethics) , non-maleficence , and justice. Respect for autonomy requires that individuals have control over their own data and decisions. Beneficence requires that AI be used to do good, such as improving the quality of care and reducing health disparities. Non-maleficence requires that AI be used to do no harm, such as avoiding discrimination in decisions. Finally, justice requires that AI be used fairly, such as using the same standards for decisions no matter a person's race, gender, or income level. As of March 2021, the OCR had hired a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (OCAIO) to pursue the \"implementation of the HHS AI strategy\". [ 144 ] With the second Trump administration deregulation of health AI began on January 20, 2025 with merely voluntary standards for collecting and sharing data, statutory definitions for algorithmic discrimination, automation bias, and equity being cancelled, cuts to NIST and 19% of FDA workforce eliminated. [ 132 ] Europe [ edit ] Other countries have implemented data protection regulations, more specifically with company privacy invasions. In Denmark, the Danish Expert Group on data ethics has adopted recommendations on 'Data for the Benefit of the People'. These recommendations are intended to encourage the responsible use of data in the business sector, with a focus on data processing. The recommendations include a focus on equality and non-discrimination with regard to bias in AI, as well as human dignity which is to outweigh profit and must be respected in all data processes. [ 145 ] The European Union has implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect citizens' personal data, which applies to the use of AI in healthcare. In addition, the European Commission has established guidelines to ensure the ethical development of AI, including the use of algorithms to ensure fairness and transparency. [ 146 ] With GDPR, the European Union was the first to regulate AI through data protection legislation. The Union finds privacy as a fundamental human right, it wants to prevent unconsented and secondary uses of data by private or public health facilities. By streamlining access to personal data for health research and findings, they are able to instate the right and importance of patient privacy. [ 146 ] In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires organizations to protect the privacy and security of patient information. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have also released guidelines for the development of AI-based medical applications. [ 147 ] In 2025, Europe was leading the USA on AI regulation, while lagging in innovation and at least one California-based biotech company was \"engaging the European Medicines Agency earlier in development than previously anticipated to mitigate concerns about the FDA's ability to meet development timelines.\" [ 132 ] Ethical concerns [ edit ] While research on the use of AI in healthcare aims to validate its efficacy in improving patient outcomes before its broader adoption, its use may introduce several new types of risk to patients and healthcare providers, such as algorithmic bias , Do not resuscitate implications, and other machine morality issues. AI may also compromise the protection of patients' rights, such as the right to informed consent and the right to medical data protection. [ 148 ] Data collection, privacy - autonomy [ edit ] In order to effectively train Machine Learning and use AI in healthcare, massive amounts of data must be gathered. Acquiring this data, however, comes at the cost of patient privacy , i.e. autonomy in most cases and is not well received publicly. For example, a survey conducted in the UK estimated that 63% of the population is uncomfortable with sharing their personal data in order to improve artificial intelligence technology. [ 149 ] The scarcity of real, accessible patient data is a hindrance that deters the progress of developing and deploying more artificial intelligence in healthcare. The lack of regulations surrounding AI in the United States has generated concerns about mismanagement of patient data, such as with corporations utilizing patient data for financial gain. For example, as of 2020 Roche , a Swiss healthcare company, was found to have purchased healthcare data for approximately 2 million cancer patients at an estimated total cost of $1.9 billion. [ 150 ] Naturally, this generates questions of ethical concern; Is there a monetary price that can be set for data, and should it depend on its perceived value or contributions to science? Is it fair to patients to sell their data? These concerns were addressed in a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2022 that asked Americans for their opinions about the increased presence of AI in their daily lives, and the survey estimated that 37% of Americans were more concerned than excited about such increased presence, with 8% of participants specifically associating their concern with \"people misusing AI\". [ 151 ] Ultimately, the current potential of artificial intelligence in healthcare is additionally hindered by  concerns about mismanagement of data collected, especially in the United States. Automation- beneficence [ edit ] A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic , or fulfill beneficence . [ 16 ] According to a 2019 study, AI can replace up to 35% of jobs in the UK within the next 10 to 20 years. [ 152 ] However, of these jobs, it was concluded that AI has not eliminated any healthcare jobs so far. Though if AI were to automate healthcare-related jobs, the jobs most susceptible to automation would be those dealing with digital information, radiology, and pathology, as opposed to those dealing with doctor-to-patient interaction. [ 152 ] Ouutputs can be incorrect or incomplete and diagnosis and recommendations harm people. [ 132 ] Bias, discrimination [ edit ] Since AI makes decisions solely on the data it receives as input, it is important that this data represents accurate patient demographics. In a hospital setting, patients do not have full knowledge of how predictive algorithms are created or calibrated. Therefore, these medical establishments can unfairly code their algorithms to discriminate against minorities and prioritize profits rather than providing optimal care, i.e. violating the ethical principle of social justice or non-maleficence . [ 153 ] A recent scoping review identified 18 equity challenges along with 15 strategies that can be implemented to help address them when AI applications are developed using many-to-many mapping. [ 154 ] There can be unintended bias in algorithms that can exacerbate social and healthcare inequities. [ 153 ] Since AI's decisions are a direct reflection of its input data, the data it receives must have accurate representation of patient demographics. For instance, if populations are less represented in healthcare data it is likely to create bias in AI tools that lead to incorrect assumptions of a demographic and impact the ability to provide appropriate care. [ 155 ] White males are overly represented in medical data sets. [ 156 ] Therefore, having minimal patient data on minorities can lead to AI making more accurate predictions for majority populations, leading to unintended worse medical outcomes for minority populations. [ 157 ] Collecting data from minority communities can also lead to medical discrimination. For instance, HIV is a prevalent virus among minority communities and HIV status can be used to discriminate against patients. [ 156 ] In addition to biases that may arise from sample selection, different clinical systems used to collect data may also impact AI functionality. For example, radiographic systems and their outcomes (e.g., resolution) vary by provider. Moreover, clinician work practices, such as the positioning of the patient for radiography, can also greatly influence the data and make comparability difficult. [ 158 ] However, these biases are able to be eliminated through careful implementation and a methodical collection of representative data. A final source of algorithmic bias , which has been called \"label choice bias\", arises when proxy measures are used to train algorithms, that build in bias against certain groups. For example, a widely used algorithm predicted health care costs as a proxy for health care needs, and used predictions to allocate resources to help patients with complex health needs. This introduced bias because Black patients have lower costs, even when they are just as unhealthy as White patients. [ 159 ] Solutions to the \"label choice bias\" aim to match the actual target (what the algorithm is predicting) more closely to the ideal target (what researchers want the algorithm to predict), so for the prior example, instead of predicting cost, researchers would focus on the variable of healthcare needs which is rather more significant. Adjusting the target led to almost double the number of Black patients being selected for the program. History [ edit ] Research in the 1960s and 1970s produced the first problem-solving program, or expert system , known as Dendral . [ 160 ] [ 161 ] While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry, it provided the basis for a subsequent system MYCIN , [ 162 ] considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine. [ 162 ] [ 163 ] MYCIN and other systems such as INTERNIST-1 and CASNET did not achieve routine use by practitioners, however. [ 164 ] The 1980s and 1990s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity. During this time, there was a recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physicians. [ 165 ] Approaches involving fuzzy set theory, [ 166 ] Bayesian networks , [ 167 ] and artificial neural networks , [ 168 ] [ 169 ] have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare. Medical and technological advancements occurring over this half-century period that have enabled the growth of healthcare-related applications of AI to include: Improvements in computing power resulting in faster data collection and data processing [ 170 ] Growth of genomic sequencing databases [ 171 ] Widespread implementation of electronic health record systems [ 172 ] Improvements in natural language processing and computer vision , enabling machines to replicate human perceptual processes [ 173 ] [ 174 ] Enhanced the precision of robot-assisted surgery [ 175 ] Increased tree-based machine learning models that allow flexibility in establishing health predictors [ 176 ] Improvements in deep learning techniques and data logs for rare diseases See also [ edit ] AI alignment Artificial intelligence in mental health Artificial intelligence Glossary of artificial intelligence Full body scanner (i.e. Dermascanner , ...)
